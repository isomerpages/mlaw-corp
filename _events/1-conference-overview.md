The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) and the Singapore Ministry of Law will be co-organising the **China-Singapore International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference** on 24 January 2019 in Beijing, China, to support the development of the Belt & Road Initiative and advance China-Singapore cooperation in international commercial legal services.
 
The organisation of the conference will be supported by the CCPIT Legal Affairs Department, the CCPIT Mediation Centre, and Maxwell Chambers, Singapore.
 
The China-Singapore International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference will explore new opportunities for commercial legal services under the Belt and Road Initiative and discuss how China and Singapore can work together to help businesses resolve commercial disputes more effectively, conveniently and fairly through the use of mediation, arbitration and/or litigation, to advance cross-border commerce, investment and economic cooperation.
 
The Conference will bring together about 250 government officials, legal and dispute resolution practitioners, in-house counsels and C-suite executives from Singapore and China to discuss these key issues and more.
 
We would like to cordially invite you to attend the China-Singapore International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference!
