Previous amendments to the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Conveyancing) Rules
---

Rule 2(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Conveyancing) Rules 2011 was amended pursuant to queries about the interaction of Rule 1 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Conveyancing) Rules 2011, which brings the Rules into operation on 1 August 2011, and Rule 2(1), which could be interpreted to mean that the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Conveyancing) Rules 2011 only apply to agreements entered into on or after 1 August 2011, and thus, the receipt and holding of conveyancing money from those agreements.

The amendment to Rule 2(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property (Conveyancing) Rules 2011 serves to clarify that the Rules also apply to conveyancing money that is received or held on or after 1 August 2011 regardless of whether the agreement in respect of the conveyancing transaction pursuant to which the money is held is entered into before, on or after 1 August 2011.

The amendment was gazetted on 19 August 2011.
