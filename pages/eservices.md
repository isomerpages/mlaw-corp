Please be advised that  you may encounter problems with making payments via eNETS. We are aware of the issue and are working urgently to resolve it. Thank you for your patience.

New Insolvency Office (IO) E-Services: We have launched our new Debt Repayment Scheme E-Services on 21 June 2022. The new E-Services have new features and members of the public will have access to guides to navigate the E-Services with ease. The new features include: 1) Online portal for Debtors and Creditors to access DRS E-Services, 2) Singpass login for easy access and secure user authentication, 3) A cleaner, guided and more user-friendly user interface, 4) Dashboard for consolidated views of submissions and statuses, 5) Step-by-step indicator to show your progress in filling up the form, and 6) Draft application form to save your entry and continue later. Things to Note:  You need a valid Singpass or Corppass account to access the new E-Services. For foreigners (non PR or FIN holder), you will be required to register for a Singpass for Foreigner.
