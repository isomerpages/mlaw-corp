<h4><strong>1.&nbsp;Basic Features Of Express Trusts</strong></h4>
<p>An express trust is formed when a <strong>settlor</strong> intentionally
transfers property to a <strong>trustee</strong>, for the trustee to hold
on trust for <strong>beneficiaries. </strong>A settlor can also declare
himself to be a trustee for the beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The trustee is the legal owner of the property held under the trust. He
holds and manages the trust property for the benefit of the beneficiaries,
and distributes the income and capital of the trust property to them, according
to the terms of the trust set out by the settlor.</p>
<p>The beneficiaries have a beneficial interest in the trust property. This
means that they, rather than the settlor or trustee, are entitled to benefit
from the trust property.</p>
<p>The settlor also has the option to appoint a <strong>protector</strong> to
supervise the trustee and prevent the trustee from abusing his powers.
Protector(s), if appointed, typically have the power to veto or authorise
the trustee in carrying out certain functions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Properties that are typically placed in trusts include cash, real property,
family businesses, shares, jewellery, art and more.</p>
<p><u>What Trusts Are For</u>
</p>
<p>Trusts may be set up for a number of reasons, including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Wealth protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Succession/Estate planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide for a dependent with special needs <a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/trusts/charitable-purpose-trusts/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Charitable purposes</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commercial purposes, such as collective investment schemes (regulated
under the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/act/sfa2001" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Securities and Futures Act 2001</a>)
and business trusts (governed by the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/BTA2004" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Business Trusts Act 2004</a>).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>2. Setting Up An Express Trust</strong></h4>
<p>For a trust to be valid, it has to fulfil the “three certainties”, namely:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Certainty of intention</strong>: The settlor must have intended
to create a trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Certainty of subject matter</strong>: The trust asset must be
identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Certainty of objects</strong>: The beneficiary or beneficiaries
must be identified or identifiable. <a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the above-mentioned requirements are not met, the trust is invalid,
and the purported beneficiaries will not be entitled to benefit from the
trust property. Instead, ownership of the trust property will remain with
the settlor.</p>
<p>An express trust can be created orally and without formalities, or in
writing through a trust deed which specifies the terms of the trust.</p>
<p>In specific circumstances, certain formalities may be required. For example:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>&nbsp;A trust over immovable property has to be manifested and proved
in writing, and signed by some person who is able to declare such a trust
(section 7 of the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CLA1909" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Civil Law Act 1909</a>). Further,
the trust property must also be conveyed to the trustee(s) by deed in the
English language (section 53 of the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CLPA1886" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1886</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A testamentary trust (i.e. a trust that takes effect on the settlor’s
death) is typically declared by a testator in his will or codicil. Such
a testamentary trust has to comply with the formalities in the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/WA1838" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Wills Act 1838</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that you consult a lawyer when setting up a trust. You
may wish to use the <a href="https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/lsra/search-lawyer-or-law-firm/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Legal Services Regulatory Authority’s ("LSRA") website</a> to
find a suitable solicitor or law practice in Singapore.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may also approach a licensed trust company or other
professionals for trust-related services. Please refer to the section below.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Trustees in Singapore</strong></h4>
<p>The trustee manages the trust property for the benefit of the beneficiaries,
and distributes the income and capital of the trust property to them. You
should choose your trustee carefully if you wish to set up a trust. You
may wish to consider the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Licensed Trust Company ("LTC")</strong>: In Singapore, persons
who carry on a trust business are licensed and regulated by the Monetary
Authority of Singapore ("<strong>MAS</strong>") under the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/TCA2005" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trust Companies Act 2005</a> unless
specifically exempted. LTCs are able to act as trustees of express trusts,
provide services in relation to the creation of an express trust, as well
as provide trust administration services. You may wish to refer to <a href="https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution?sector=Capital%20Markets&amp;category=Licensed%20Trust%20Company" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MAS’ directory of financial institutions</a> for
a list of LTCs in Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private Trust Company ("PTC"):</strong> You may wish to consider
setting up a PTC. A PTC is established to act as a trustee to a trust or
a number of trusts created by a settlor or settlors who are connected to
the beneficiaries by blood or legal adoption. PTCs do not have to obtain
a license from MAS, but have to engage an LTC to carry out certain trust
administration services, including AML/CFT checks. You may wish to refer
to the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/TCA2005-RG1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trust Companies (Exemption) Regulations</a> for
further information. Please seek legal advice and/or approach an LTC if
you wish to set up a PTC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lawyers and Law Firms:</strong> Lawyers and law firms can act as
trustees if they are an LTC, or if they fall within an exemption in the
<a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/TCA2005-RG1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trust Companies (Exemption) Regulations</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Others:</strong> You can also consider choosing family members,
close friends, or others who you know you can rely on to be a trustee.
Think carefully about who to approach, and make sure that they are willing
to take on the responsibility and duties involved in acting as a trustee
(see next section).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>4.&nbsp;Trustees’ Obligations &amp; Duties</strong></h4>
<p><u>Trustees’ Duties Owed To The Beneficiaries</u>
</p>
<p>Trustees manage trust assets for the benefit of beneficiaries. They have
certain obligations and duties, including:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Non-Fiduciary Duties</strong>: These include: (i) a duty to exercise
reasonable care and skill; (ii) administrative duties, such as a duty to
make inquiries regarding what constitutes the trust property when he is
appointed; (iii) a duty to safeguard assets; and (iv) a duty to give proper,
complete and accurate justification and documentation for his actions as
a trustee.</p>
<p>The trustee has to keep proper accounts of the trust (and the transactions
made) and be prepared to furnish the accounts for inspection by the beneficiaries
when requested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiduciary Duties</strong>: A trustee’s fiduciary duties include:
(i) a duty to act in good faith and for proper purposes; (ii) a duty not
to make a profit out of the trust; and (iii) a duty to not place himself
in a position of conflict.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trustees should seek their own legal advice should they require more information
as to the precise nature of their duties.</p>
<p>A breach of the above duties could potentially render a trustee liable
to civil or criminal liabilities. For example, a beneficiary may sue the
trustee in Court to seek legal or equitable remedies, such as for compensation
or to recover profits that the trustee obtained from the breach. As another
example, a trustee who has misappropriated trust property may have committed
the offence of criminal breach of trust under the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Penal Code 1871</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>AML/CFT obligations</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (“<strong>FATF</strong>”)
which establishes international standards for Anti-Money Laundering, Countering
the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation Financing. Singapore is also
a member of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information
for Tax Purposes.</p>
<p>In line with these international standards, Singapore requires trustees
to:</p>
<p>1. Obtain and verify information of relevant trust parties (i.e. all settlors,
trustees, protectors, beneficiaries, and persons who have any power over
the disposition of the trust);</p>
<p>2. Obtain and verify information about the effective controllers of relevant
trust parties;</p>
<p>3. Obtain information about persons appointed or engaged as a service
supplier to the relevant trust (i.e. an agent of, or a service provider
to, the relevant trust including any investment adviser or manager, accountant
or tax adviser);</p>
<p>4. Update information in (1) – (3) in a timely manner and maintain records
for at least 5 years after the trustee ceases to be a trustee of the relevant
trust; and</p>
<p>5. Keep accounting records.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with any of the obligations listed above is an offence.</p>
<p>These obligations are set out in either:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/notices/notice-tca-n03" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Notice TCA-N03 on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism </a>for
LTCs <a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[3]</a> and
PTCs <a href="#_ftn4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[4]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For most other trustees, the obligations are stipulated in <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/TA1967" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Part 7 of the Trustees Act 1967</a> (“<strong>Trustees Act</strong>”)
and <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/TA1967-S151-2017" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trustees (Transparency and Effective Control) Regulations 2017</a> (“<strong>Trustees Regulations</strong>”)
if (i) the trust is governed by Singapore law, (ii) administered in Singapore,
or (iii) any of the trustees are resident in Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The police may also require the trustee to produce the abovementioned
information in a timely manner pursuant to powers of investigation under
the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Criminal Procedure Code 2010</a> (“<strong>CPC</strong>”),
where it considers the information to be necessary or desirable for any
investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the CPC.</p>
<p>For trustees whose obligations are stipulated in the Trustees Act and
the Trustees Regulations, they are also required to inform certain “specified
persons” that they are acting for a relevant trust before forming a business
relationship, or entering a transaction of more than $20,000 (whether the
transaction is carried out in a single operation or in multiple linked
operations) with that “specified person”. “Specified person” would include
financial institutions, licensed estate agents, and lawyers.</p>
<p><u>Report a Suspected Breach of a Trustee’s AML/CFT Obligations</u>
</p>
<p>If you suspect a trustee may have breached its respective obligations
above, please write to us at <a href="https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/enquiry/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link.</a> Should your
concerns relate to LTCs or PTCs, please submit the details at <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/consumerfeedback-form/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a> on
the MAS website.</p>
<p>As you may be contacted to assist in further investigations, please provide
your name and contact details. Law enforcement agencies will follow up
accordingly where it is decided that an investigation is warranted. Please
be assured that your identity will be protected and kept confidential as
far as possible. However, under certain circumstances, your identity may
be revealed to other parties on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<p>Please note that unless you are contacted to provide further information,
you will not be updated on how the information is dealt with, including
on whether investigations are being conducted, and the status or outcome
of the investigations in the event that the investigations are carried
out.</p>
<p>If you suspect that a serious offence has been committed, such as fraud,
misappropriation or money laundering, please make a police report at
<a href="https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/e-services-general/police-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
<p>If you suspect that a serious offence has been committed that needs immediate
action, please make a police report by calling 999 or SMS 71999.</p>
<h4><strong>5. Filing of Tax Returns</strong></h4>
<p>Trusts need to file a tax return with the Inland Revenue Authority of
Singapore ("<strong>IRAS</strong>") to declare the amount of Singapore
taxable income that was derived in the year preceding the year of assessment.
Failure to do so may result in penalties. Please refer to <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/other-taxes/trusts" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IRAS’ website</a> for
more details, including requesting for a tax reference number.</p>
