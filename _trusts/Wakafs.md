<h4><strong>1. Basic Features of Wakafs</strong></h4>
<p>Under Singapore law, a <em>wakaf </em>is a permanent dedication by a Muslim
of any movable or immovable property for any purpose recognised by the
Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable (section 2 of the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/act/amla1966" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Administration of Muslim Law Act 1966</a>("<strong>AMLA</strong>")).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<em>wakaf</em>&nbsp;consists of a donor (the&nbsp;<em>wakif</em>),
who by declaration (<em>sighah</em>) donates his assets (<em>mauquf</em>)
to Allah s.w.t. Legal ownership of all <em>wakaf</em> assets automatically
vests in Majlis Ugama Islam Singapore (“MUIS”) (i.e. the Islamic Religious
Council of Singapore), which has been held by the Courts to be the trustee-equivalent
for <em>wakafs</em>.</p>
<p>Only the income generated from the <em>wakaf</em> asset(s) can be distributed
to the beneficiaries (<em>muquf’alaih</em>). The capital (i.e., the original <em>wakaf</em> asset(s))
must be kept intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;More details about wakafs can be found on the <a href="https://www.muis.gov.sg/wakaf/Understanding-Wakaf/Overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MUIS' website</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>2.&nbsp;Regulation of Wakafs</strong></h4>
<p>All <em>wakafs</em> must be registered with MUIS, which is also required
to maintain a register of <em>wakafs</em>. For the purposes of registration,
MUIS will collect the following particulars amongst others:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full particulars, including contact information,
of the <em>mutawalli</em>;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of beneficiaries (or class of beneficiaries)
and objects of the <em>wakaf</em>;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A description of the <em>wakaf</em> properties
sufficient for the identification of the properties;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gross annual income from the <em>wakaf</em> properties;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of rates and taxes annually payable
in respect of the <em>wakaf </em>properties;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An estimate of the expenses annually incurred
in the realisation to the income of the <em>wakaf</em> properties; and</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount set apart under the<em> wakaf</em> for&nbsp;—
(i) the salary of the <em>mutawalli</em> and allowances to the individuals;
(ii) purely religious purposes; (iii) charitable purposes; and (iv) pious
and any other purposes.</p>
<p><em>Wakafs</em> are managed by <em>mutawallis</em>. MUIS acts as the <em>mutawalli</em> of
wakafs unless there are reasons for a private <em>mutawalli</em> to be better
able to carry out the objectives of the <em>wakaf</em>.</p>
<p>Private <em>mutawallis</em> are screened and must be approved by MUIS before
they are appointed. They have to comply with the AMLA, and the Administration
of Muslim Law (Wakaf and Nazar Am) Rules. Amongst other things, <em>mutawallis</em> are
required to keep proper accounts and records of all receipts, expenditure
and investment of moneys belong to the <em>wakaf</em>, and are required
to prepare audited financial statements after the close of each financial
year. Failure to do so is an offence.</p>
<p>Private <em>mutawallis</em> also have to abide by the terms and conditions
set out by MUIS in their letter of appointment. The terms include duties
to safeguard the <em>wakaf</em> properties, and to keep regular and proper
records including of the transactions that they undertake, and the specific
beneficiaries who they make disbursements to.</p>
<p>Private <em>mutawallis</em> may be removed by MUIS at any time.</p>
<p>The police may require MUIS and private <em>mutawallis</em> to produce information
regarding the&nbsp;<em>wakaf</em>&nbsp;pursuant to its powers under the&nbsp;
<a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Criminal Procedure Code 2010</a>&nbsp;(“<strong>CPC</strong>”), where
it considers the information to be necessary for desirable for any investigation,
inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the CPC.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Filing of Tax Returns</strong></h4>
<p><em>Wakafs</em> vested in MUIS are exempted from income tax under Section
13(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1947.</p>
