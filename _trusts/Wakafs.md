<h4><strong>1. Basic Features of Wakafs</strong></h4>
<p>Under Singapore law, a <em>wakaf </em>is a permanent dedication by a Muslim
of any movable or immovable property for any purpose recognised by the
Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable (section 2 of the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/act/amla1966" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Administration of Muslim Law Act 1966</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <em>wakaf</em> consists of a donor (the <em>wakif</em>), who by declaration
(<em>sighah</em>) donates his assets (<em>mauquf</em>) to Allah s.w.t.
A trustee (<em>mutawalli</em>) will be appointed to manage the asset. The
trustee is obliged to keep the capital (i.e., the original asset(s)) intact.
Only the income generated from the asset(s) is distributed to the beneficiaries
(<em>muquf’alaih</em>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;More details about wakafs can be found on the <a href="https://www.muis.gov.sg/wakaf/Understanding-Wakaf/Overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website of the Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (“MUIS”)</a> (i.e.
the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore).</p>
<h4><strong>2.&nbsp;Regulation of Wakafs</strong></h4>
<p>All <em>wakafs</em> must be registered with MUIS, which is also required
to maintain a register of <em>wakafs</em>. For the purposes of registration,
MUIS will collect the following particulars amongst others:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full particulars, including contact information,
of the trustees;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of beneficiaries (or class of beneficiaries)
and objects of the <em>wakaf</em>;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A description of the <em>wakaf</em> properties
sufficient for the identification of the properties;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gross annual income from the <em>wakaf</em> properties;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of rates and taxes annually payable
in respect of the <em>wakaf </em>properties;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An estimate of the expenses annually incurred
in the realisation to the income of the <em>wakaf</em> properties; and</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount set apart under the<em> wakaf</em> for&nbsp;—
(i) the salary of the trustee and allowances to the individuals; (ii) purely
religious purposes; (iii) charitable purposes; and (iv) pious and any other
purposes.</p>
<p>MUIS is the custodian of all <em>wakafs</em> in Singapore and has extensive
powers over each <em>wakaf</em>. For instance, prior approval in writing
from MUIS must first be obtained before a person may be appointed as a
trustee under an instrument or declaration creating a <em>wakaf. </em>In
the process, MUIS may impose terms and conditions on the trustees concerning
their appointment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Further, the trustee must keep proper accounts and records of its
transactions and affairs and prepare financial statements in respect of
the <em>wakaf </em>after the close of each financial year. Such financial
statements must be submitted to MUIS.</p>
<p>The police may require MUIS to produce information regarding the <em>wakaf</em> pursuant
to its powers under the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Criminal Procedure Code 2010</a> (“<strong>CPC</strong>”),
where it considers the information to be necessary for desirable for any
investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the CPC.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>3. Filing of Tax Returns</strong></h4>
<p><em>Wakafs</em> vested in MUIS are exempted from income tax under Section
13(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1947.</p>
