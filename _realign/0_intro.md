## Re-Align Framework to Renegotiate Contracts for Businesses Significantly Impacted by COVID-19 ##

> “The framework will provide a <b>quick and fair way</b> for businesses to <b>realign and move forward</b> by allowing selected contracts to be <b>renegotiated</b> by way of <b>mutual agreement</b> with the counterparties. If they are unable to agree, the contract may be <b>terminated</b> within the provided parameters. Businesses will <b>remain liable for outstanding obligations but will not need to pay early termination penalties</b>.” 

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the viability of some businesses and changed the assumptions upon which businesses entered into contracts before COVID-19. While the Government has allowed the calibrated resumption of economic and social activities, safe distancing and travel restrictions will continue to impact many sectors.

Small Businesses and individuals who have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and need to review their business models and contractual obligations will benefit from the Re-Align Framework, which commenced on **<u>15 January 2021</u>**.

The Framework will provide a quick and fair way for businesses to realign their contracts with current business conditions by allowing selected contracts to be renegotiated by way of mutual agreement with the counterparties. If they are unable to agree, the contract may be terminated within the provided parameters. Businesses will remain liable for outstanding obligations but will not need to pay early termination penalties.
