### <a name="faq">FAQs</a> <a href="#f1" title="Return to top">↩</a> ###

**1.	Who are the Assessors?**

Determinations will be made by a panel of Assessors, comprising qualified lawyers and accountants. 

**2.	Are there any fees required in seeking an Assessor’s determination?**

No. Parties will not be charged any fees or costs when an Assessor is appointed to make a determination under the Framework.  
 
**3.	The other party has disclosed information and supporting documents in the course of proceedings before the Assessors. Can I disclose or publish that information to a third party?**

You cannot disclose to a third party any statement or document submitted, created or made for the purposes of an Assessor’s proceedings, or any information (whether written or oral) that is disclosed in the course of an Assessor’s proceedings, except:

* With the consent of the party to whom the information relates.
* When the information is already in the public domain.
* When the disclosure is necessary for the proceedings, the enforcement of an Assessor’s determination or any proceeding before a court or arbitral tribunal.  

**4.	The determination for my case has been issued. I have further information which would have a material influence on the determination. Can I ask for the determination to be revisited?**  

Section 67 of the Act provides that the Assessor or another Assessor may vary or replace the determination if there is further information which would have a material influence on the determination, but which **could not have with reasonable diligence been obtained for use at the proceedings before the Assessor where the determination was made and it is just and fair for the variation or replacement to be made**.

If you wish to apply for a variation or replacement of the determination, please write to the Registry at the email address that the Registry had previously communicated with you and provide supporting documents justifying why the determination should be varied or replaced. Each application will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and at the Assessor’s sole discretion.

Please note that **the above does not operate as an appeal**. The Assessor’s determination is **not appealable**.
