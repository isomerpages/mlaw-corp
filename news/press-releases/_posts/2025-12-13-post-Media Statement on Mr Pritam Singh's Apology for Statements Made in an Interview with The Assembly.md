<b>Background</b>

{:start=“1”}
1.&nbsp;On 17 February 2025, Mr Pritam Singh was found guilty by the Magistrate’s Court of two charges of wilfully giving false answers to a Parliamentary Committee of Privileges. The Court found that Mr Singh had lied to the Committee of Privileges on two occasions, in respect of:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) An 8 August 2021 meeting, at which Mr Singh had told Ms Raeesah Khan to take her lie to the grave; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) A 3 October 2021 meeting, where Mr Singh told Ms Khan that he would not judge her if she maintained her lie in Parliament.</p>

{:start=“2”} 
2.&nbsp;Mr Singh had falsely testified on oath that he had wanted Ms Khan to tell the truth in Parliament on both occasions and clarify the earlier falsehood, and he was therefore convicted of lying to the Committee of Privileges.

3.&nbsp;Following his conviction, Mr Singh filed an appeal against the Magistrate’s Court decision.

<b>The Assembly interview</b>

{:start=“4”} 
4.&nbsp;While the appeal was pending, Mr Singh gave an interview to The Assembly, which was aired on 5 November 2025. At the interview, he made comments suggesting, among other things, that:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) The prosecution against him by the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“AGC”) and, by extension, his conviction by the Magistrate’s Court, were politically motivated, impugning the integrity of the Court and legal system.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) The court of public opinion, demonstrated by results at the general election, was more important than the Court’s judgment.</p>

{:start=“5”} 
5.&nbsp;These comments are very wrong, and have no place in a system founded on the Rule of Law. The Minister for Law had, on 8 November 2025, noted that these comments denigrate the Court’s judgment and undermine public trust in our legal system and the Judiciary, and that this is completely unacceptable.

{:start=“6”} 
6.&nbsp;On 28 November 2025, the AGC put Mr Singh on notice that his statements are in contempt of court, and invited Mr Singh to apologise.

{:start=“7”} 
7.&nbsp;On 4 December 2025, the General Division of the High Court upheld the findings of the Magistrate’s Court and dismissed Mr Singh’s appeal.

{:start=“8”} 
8.&nbsp;Mr Singh has since duly apologised in writing for his comments made in his interview to The Assembly.

{:start=“9”} 
9.&nbsp;Following the dismissal of his appeal, Mr Singh has also confirmed that he accepts the Court’s judgment fully and without reservation. He also rightly acknowledged that it is unacceptable for politicians to question or impugn the integrity of the Courts. We welcome these comments. The Judiciary is a key pillar of Singapore’s success, and it is critical that public trust in our justice system is maintained.
