1. In a virtual ceremony held today, Singapore’s Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam SC, and France’s Minister of Justice and Keeper of the Seals, Mr Éric Dupond-Moretti signed the Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Government of the Republic of Singapore and the Government of the French Republic (the “**Agreement**”). Singapore’s Ambassador to France, Mr Zainal Arif Mantaha, and France’s Ambassador to Singapore, Mr Marc Abensour, were also present to witness the signing, which was conducted over videoconference.

2. The Agreement provides a framework for both countries to exchange requests for legal assistance in criminal matters with each other. This will ensure more effective cooperation between both countries in the prevention and suppression of crime. The Agreement is Singapore’s first mutual legal assistance treaty since 2005 and Singapore’s first bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty with a country with a civil law system.

3. Prior to the ceremony, the Ministers also exchanged views on several topics, including strengthening bilateral legal cooperation and the promotion of Singapore and Paris as investment, arbitration, and legal innovation hubs. 

4. Before the signing of the Agreement, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam SC, noted that “the Agreement will be an invaluable instrument in the fight against transnational crime. Singapore and France already cooperate closely on mutual legal assistance requests. Our law enforcement agencies have regular exchanges on issues relating to counter terrorism, cybercrime, homeland security amongst many others, and this Agreement will further cement the already strong mutual legal assistance relationship between our countries.” 

5. Minister Shanmugam and Minister Dupond-Moretti also reaffirmed the Agreement’s role in enhancing the strong relationship between Singapore and France, and looked forward to deeper legal cooperation between both countries.
