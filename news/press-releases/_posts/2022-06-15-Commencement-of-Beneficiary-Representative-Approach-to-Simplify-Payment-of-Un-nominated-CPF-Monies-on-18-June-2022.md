1.	From 18 June 2022, eligible beneficiaries of a deceased Central Provident Fund (“<b>CPF</b>”) member with un-nominated CPF monies not exceeding $10,000 will be able to claim these monies through a simplified process. Under the Beneficiary Representative (“<b>BR</b>”) approach, one representative (i.e. the BR) may make a single consolidated claim to the Public Trustee’s Office (“<b>PTO</b>”) under the Ministry of Law on behalf of all eligible beneficiaries instead of each beneficiary having to provide documents proving their familial relationship with the deceased CPF member. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 

{:start="2"}
2.	This streamlined procedure, which was introduced by the CPF (Amendment) Bill passed in Parliament on 2 November 2021, is expected to relieve the administrative burden on beneficiaries and allow for faster disbursement of CPF monies, for claims not exceeding $10,000.

**Eligibility of a BR**

{:start="3"}
3.	A person must fulfil the following criteria to be a BR:

a.	Must be an eligible beneficiary<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> according to the applicable rules of distribution under the Intestate Succession Act 1967 (for non-Muslims) or the Administration of Muslim Law Act 1966 (for Muslims);<br>

b.	Must be at least 21 years old; and<br>

c.	Must not be an undischarged bankrupt, a mentally incapacitated person or a prison inmate. 

{:start="4"}
4.	In addition, the BR must have obtained consent from all eligible beneficiaries to represent them and receive their share of the CPF monies on their behalf. In processing the BR’s application, the PTO will send an email to each beneficiary to seek his or her confirmation of consent. This is to protect the interest of all the eligible beneficiaries and ensure that a consensus has been reached before the PTO proceeds with the disbursement of the deceased CPF member’s un-nominated CPF monies. 

{:start="5"}
5.	The PTO will start accepting applications for claims under the BR approach via the e-Services portal at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/pto-eservices" target="new">https://go.gov.sg/pto-eservices</a> on 18 June 2022.
