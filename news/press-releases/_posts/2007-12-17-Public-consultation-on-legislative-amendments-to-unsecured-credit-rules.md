**The public consultation is now <u>closed</u>.**


1. Last year, MAS and the Ministry of Law ("MinLaw") conducted a joint public consultation on the proposed changes to the unsecured credit rules for financial institutions and the proposed application of these rules to moneylenders with appropriate modifications. MAS had also conducted another consultation this year on the exemption for financial institutions from the maximum credit limit when granting credit to individuals with greater financial means. Pursuant to the feedback received, MAS and MinLaw have proceeded to draft respective rules applicable to unsecured lending by financial institutions regulated under MAS and moneylenders under MinLaw.

2. MAS and MinLaw would like to invite interested parties to forward their views and comments on these draft rules. Electronic submission is encouraged. Please submit your written comments by 17 January 2008 to:
