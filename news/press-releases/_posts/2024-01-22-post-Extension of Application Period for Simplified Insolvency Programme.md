1. The Ministry of Law (“<b>MinLaw</b>”) will extend the application period for the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“<b>SIP</b>”)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> by 24 months, from 29 January 2024 to 28 January 2026.

{:start="2"}
2. The SIP was introduced on 29 January 2021 for the benefit of eligible micro and small companies (“<b>MSCs</b>”)<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> facing financial difficulties, by helping them restructure their debts to rehabilitate their business, or wind up via a simpler, faster and lower cost insolvency process.

3. The SIP is administered by the Official Receiver and comprises two separate processes that:
    
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
	a) assist viable but distressed MSCs to restructure their debts with their creditors via the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“<b>SDRP</b>”); and&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
	b) assist unviable MSCs to wind up via the Simplified Winding Up Programme (“<b>SWUP</b>”).</p>
