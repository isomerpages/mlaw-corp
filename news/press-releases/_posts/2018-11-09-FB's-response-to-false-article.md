Facebook has declined to take down a post that is clearly false, defamatory and attacks Singapore, using falsehoods.

This shows why we need legislation to protect us from deliberate online falsehoods.

Many Malaysian publications, including China Press, that had initially reported STR’s malicious post, took it down after our High Commission in Malaysia issued a clarification to say the post was false and libellous.

Sarawak Report and its editor Ms Clare Rewcastle Brown have issued two statements to say STR’s claim that the Report had declared Singapore to be the next target of the 1MDB investigation was false.

But Facebook does not feel all this is sufficient grounds for it to remove the post. FB cannot be relied upon to filter falsehoods or protect Singapore from a false information campaign.
