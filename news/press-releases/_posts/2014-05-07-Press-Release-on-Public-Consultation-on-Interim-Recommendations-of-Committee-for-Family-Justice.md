1. The Committee for Family Justice is inviting views from the public on the Committee’s key interim recommendations to reform the family justice system.


2. The Committee for Family Justice was set up in early 2013 to study how the family justice system can be strengthened.   The Committee has submitted its interim recommendations to solicit feedback from the public. These are outlined in the Public Consultation Paper attached as Annex.

<ol start="3">
<li> The Committee’s key interim recommendations include:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li> <strong>Empowering community touch points</strong> such as Family Service Centres, schools, hospitals, charities, MPs and lawyers to direct families to the appropriate providers of solutions for their issues, both pre- and post-court.</li>
<li><strong> Enhancing social support service providers and integrating them with the family courts system.</strong> This includes the establishment of Specialist Agencies in key community nodes across Singapore that will provide a range of services to address issues arising from divorce. These Specialist Agencies will be additional to the three existing ones for dealing with Family Violence. They will provide services such as information and non-legal advice, case management by social workers, counselling and family dispute management.</li>
<li><strong>Creating a comprehensive specialist family court structure known as the Family Justice Courts through a new Family Justice Act.</strong> This will introduce enhanced court management processes that will empower the court to adjudicate and resolve family disputes more effectively, and lessen the trauma of the divorce process. Changes will also be made to provide greater assistance to the high numbers of litigants who act in person within the family court.</li>
<li><strong>Placing more emphasis on addressing the interests of children in divorces</strong>. The proposed measures include: (a) expanding the mandate of the existing Counselling and Psychological Servicers of the State Courts, which currently provides a voice to the child, to better represent the child; (b) appointing Child Representatives in appropriate court proceedings to act as their advocate; and (c) involving social service professionals in court proceedings to ensure that the best interests of the child are promoted.</li>
