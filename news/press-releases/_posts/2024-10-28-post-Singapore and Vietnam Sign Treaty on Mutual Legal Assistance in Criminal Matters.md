4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOS Murali said, “Singapore and Vietnam enjoy close and longstanding relations, diplomatically, as well as in the fields of economic, technical and legal cooperation. Singapore and Vietnam are also parties to the ASEAN Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, and we have had close cooperation under that Treaty for many years. The Treaty builds on this strong foundation and paves the way for even more effective cooperation in the prevention and suppression of crime."
