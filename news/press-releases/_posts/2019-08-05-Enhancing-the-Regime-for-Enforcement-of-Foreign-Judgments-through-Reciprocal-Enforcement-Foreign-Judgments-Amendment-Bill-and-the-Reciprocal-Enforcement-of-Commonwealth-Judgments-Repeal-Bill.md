1. The Ministry of Law (“MinLaw”) submitted the Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments (Amendment) Bill (“Amendment Bill”) and the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments (Repeal) Bill (“Repeal Bill”) for First Reading in Parliament today.
 
2. The Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (“REFJA”), together with the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (“RECJA”), facilitate the registration, and subsequent enforcement, of foreign judgments in civil proceedings in Singapore. Currently, only judgments from the superior courts of 11 jurisdictions may be registered under REFJA and RECJA. The Bills do not cover judgments or decisions in criminal cases.
 
3. The Bills are part of Singapore’s policy reforms to increase the eligibility of Singapore’s civil judgments for recognition and enforcement overseas. 
 
4. The Amendment Bill amends REFJA to increase the types of foreign judgments in civil proceedings that can be enforced in Singapore. As the regime works on a reciprocal basis, this amendment will provide the Government with more flexibility and scope to enter into new treaties to enhance the recognition and enforcement of Singapore judgments overseas, for the benefit of judgment creditors.
 
5. The Repeal Bill repeals the RECJA on a date to be stipulated by the Minister. When the Repeal Bill comes into operation, it will streamline Singapore’s legal framework for the statutory recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments in civil proceedings such that we operate a single statutory regime under the REFJA.


**Increasing the types of foreign judgments that can be enforced**

{:start="6"}
6. Currently, only final money judgments from foreign superior courts are recognised under REFJA. As enforcement of foreign judgments depends on reciprocal arrangements between at least two countries, this means that only final money judgments issued from the High Court and the Court of Appeal are enforceable overseas.
 

<ol start="7">
<li>The Amendment Bill extends the scope of REFJA to recognise and enforce: - 

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><b>Non-money judgments</b>: Non-money judgments are increasingly important in commercial litigation. The Singapore courts would have the discretion to register foreign non-money judgments in civil proceedings if it considers that enforcement would be just and convenient. If enforcement would not be just and convenient, the Singapore courts have the discretion to make an order for the registration of a foreign judgment of such amount as it considers is the monetary equivalent of the relief sought;</li>
<li><b>Lower court judgments</b>: This will allow judgments in civil proceedings from the State Courts to be enforced in foreign jurisdictions on a reciprocal basis; and</li>
<li><b>Interlocutory judgments</b>: Interlocutory judgments are important in preserving the rights of the litigants before a final judgment is obtained. For example, the freezing injunction prevents litigants from dissipating their assets before final judgment. The ability to enforce Singapore interlocutory judgments in foreign jurisdictions will enhance the attractiveness of Singapore courts to litigants.</li>
</ol>
</li>

</ol>


**New provisions to prevent reciprocity requirement from being circumvented**


{:start="8"} 
8. Reciprocity is a key requirement in mutual recognition of judgments between at least two countries. As such, recognition of foreign judgments in REFJA is founded on substantial reciprocity of treatment by foreign countries.
 
<ol start="9">
<li>To ensure that the reciprocity requirements in REFJA are not circumvented, the REFJA Amendment Bill provides that certain types of foreign judgments will not be recognised. For example, 
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>a judgment given by a recognised court, on appeal from a court that is not a recognised court; or</li>
<li>a judgment given by a recognised court in proceedings founded on a judgment of a court in another foreign country and having as their object the enforcement of the second mentioned judgment
<br>
 <br>
will not be included under REFJA.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

**Repeal of RECJA to operate a single statutory regime under REFJA**

{:start="10"} 
10. The Repeal Bill provides for the repeal of the RECJA on a date to be stipulated by the Minister. Before the Repeal Bill comes into effect, reciprocating countries recognised under the RECJA are expected to be transferred to the REFJA. After the Repeal Bill comes into effect, there will be a single regime under the REFJA.
