1. The Registry of Moneylenders, a division of the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office, brought charges in the State Courts on 10 March 2014 against Tan Chiu Wui( 陈秋伟), 44 years old, a director of the moneylending company, Uni Cash 88 Pte. Ltd (previously known as Uni Development Pte Ltd).

2. The company held a moneylending licence from 16 February 2011 to 15 February 2014, which was not renewed after it expired as investigations revealed that the company had committed offences which warranted prosecution.

3. On 7 August 2014, Tan pleaded guilty in the State Courts and was convicted on one out of two charges for a breach under Section 15(2)(a) of the Moneylenders Act for contravention of licence conditions by failing to obtain the prior approval of the Registrar of Moneylenders for the company’s telephone landline. The remaining one charge for a breach under Section 26(3) of the Moneylenders Act for failing to comply with the direction of the Registrar on permitted advertising channels was taken into consideration by the Court for the purposes of sentencing.

4. Tan was sentenced in the State Courts to a fine of $2,000 (in default ten days’ imprisonment). 27 licensed moneylenders have been convicted and fined since 2011 (see **<u>Annex A</u>**). 

5. The Registry carries out regular inspections of licensed moneylenders. Where breaches of moneylending laws are found, enforcement measures are taken, including the suspension or revocation of licences, forfeiture of security deposits, warnings and prosecutions. Those convicted of breaches of the Moneylenders Act and Rules face a fine of up to $40,000 and/or an imprisonment term of up to two years on each charge.
