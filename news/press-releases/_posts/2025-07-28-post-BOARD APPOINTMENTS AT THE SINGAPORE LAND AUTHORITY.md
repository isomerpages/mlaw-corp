3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under his leadership, SLA has made significant strides in transforming State properties to serve businesses and the community. As Chairman, Mr Yeoh pushed for the adaptive reuse of State properties for more social and community uses, successfully activating diverse spaces for community building and social good and pivoting State properties for uses that are attuned to evolving needs in the community. This includes the rejuvenation of heritage buildings such as the Former St Andrew’s Mission Hospital into vibrant community and lifestyle clusters.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Yeoh also played a key role in advancing the development of the Digital Conveyancing Portal, which will transform the current manual, paper-based conveyancing process into an efficient, streamlined digitalised process. Under Mr Yeoh’s guidance, SLA was elected co-chair of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Global GeoSpatial Information Management and implemented the refreshed National Geospatial Masterplan to drive a geo-enabled Singapore.
