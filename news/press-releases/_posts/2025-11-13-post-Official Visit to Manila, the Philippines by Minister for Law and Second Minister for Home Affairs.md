{:start="1"} 1.&nbsp;Minister for Law and Second Minister for Home Affairs Mr Edwin Tong SC will be making&nbsp; an official visit to Manila, the Philippines from 13 to 15 November 2025, where he will attend the&nbsp; 13th ASEAN Law Ministers Meeting (“<b>ALAWMM</b>”) as Singapore’s Head of Delegation.

{:start="2"} 2.&nbsp;The ALAWMM is a key forum for legal cooperation initiatives that promote ASEAN’s&nbsp; objectives. The ALAWMM takes place every two years and is tasked to, among other things,&nbsp; implement agreements and decisions of the ASEAN Summit and submit reports and&nbsp; recommendations to the ASEAN Political Security Community Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>ASEAN Treaty on Extradition</b>

{:start="3"} 3.&nbsp;Minister Tong will participate in the signing of the ASEAN Treaty on Extradition (the&nbsp; “Treaty”) by ASEAN Member States on 14 November 2025. The Treaty is the first to be developed and finalised under the auspices of ALAWMM.&nbsp;&nbsp;

{:start="4"} 4.&nbsp;The Treaty is a significant milestone in legal cooperation among ASEAN Member States.&nbsp; It provides a framework for Singapore to extradite fugitives to ASEAN Member States for extraditable offences under Singapore’s Extradition Act 1968, and in turn, to request the extradition of fugitives to Singapore from ASEAN Member States. Having an extradition treaty with Singapore’s neighbours would enhance our ability to combat transnational crime and bring fugitives to justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

{:start="5"} 5.&nbsp;The Treaty will come into force after six ASEAN Member States that have signed the&nbsp; Treaty have additionally ratified, accepted or approved the Treaty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>Bilateral Meetings</b>

{:start="6"} 6.&nbsp;During his trip, Minister Tong will also be calling on the Officer-in-Charge of the&nbsp; Department of Justice of the Philippines Mr Fredderick A. Vida, and the Philippines Secretary of&nbsp; Foreign Affairs Ms Ma. Theresa P. Lazaro.&nbsp;&nbsp;

{:start="7"} 7.&nbsp;Minister Tong will also meet with the Japanese Minister of Justice, Mr Hiroshi Hiraguchi, the Laos Vice-Minister of Justice, Mr Ketsana Phommachanh, the Timor Leste Minister of Justice,&nbsp; Mr Sérgio de Jesus Fernandes da Costa Hornai, and the Vietnam Minister of Justice, Mr Ngyuen Hai Ninh.

{:start="8"} 8.&nbsp;The Singapore delegation will also comprise Ambassador for International Law Rena Lee&nbsp; and officials from the Ministry of Law.&nbsp;
