{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;Singapore has received the first extradition request by Indonesia under the Treaty between the Government of the Republic of Singapore and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Extradition of Fugitives (“**ET**”)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> 

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;This request is being processed in accordance with Singapore’s Extradition Act 1968 and the ET. The legal process to enable the request has commenced in accordance with due process and the rule of law, in line with international practice.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;The Singapore and Indonesian authorities are working closely on this case.

**Facts of the case**

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;Paulus Tannos alias Tjhin Thian Po (“**Tannos**”) is wanted by Indonesia for corruption offences concerning Indonesia’s electronic identity card project, known as the “e-KTP project” which has allegedly incurred significant State losses.

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;On 19 December 2024, Singapore received a request from Indonesia to provisionally arrest Tannos. Following a swift but thorough review by the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“**AGC**”) and CPIB of the request in accordance with the legal requirements, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“**CPIB**”) applied to the Singapore Court on 17 January 2025 for a warrant to arrest Tannos. The Court granted the Order, and Tannos was immediately arrested the same day.

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;Upon his arrest, Tannos was put in remand without bail, pending the submission of a formal request for Tannos’ extradition.

*Formal request for Tannos’ extradition*

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;On 24 February 2025, the Singapore Government received the formal request from Indonesia to extradite Tannos. AGC, as Singapore’s Central Authority for extradition requests, has proceeded to review the request and its accompanying documents.

**Extradition process**

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;Once the legal requirements for extradition are met, the matter will be promptly placed before the Court.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;If a fugitive does not contest the extradition, extradition generally takes place in less than six months. However, if a fugitive contests the extradition, as Tannos had indicated he would, the process could take longer. This is especially if the fugitive appeals under the law, against any decision made against him by the Court at first instance. The time the extradition process takes will vary from case to case based on each case's own facts and circumstances. The Singapore Government will seek to expedite the process as quickly as possible.

**Singapore’s Commitment**

{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp;The Singapore Government is fully committed to combatting crime and upholding our role as a responsible extradition partner. The Singapore Government is taking the case very seriously, and will do all possible under the law to facilitate the request for Tannos’ extradition.
