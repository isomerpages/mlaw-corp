1.&nbsp;The Criminal Procedure (Expert Opinion) Rules 2025<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and related legislative amendments<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> will come into effect on 31 December 2025. These amendments will:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) require psychiatrists to be a member of the Panel of Psychiatrists (Panel) before they can give psychiatric expert evidence in criminal proceedings; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) provide for Rules in relation to expert evidence and reports in criminal proceedings.</p>

<b>Panel of Psychiatrists</b>

{:start=“2”}
2.&nbsp;Expert evidence from psychiatrists plays a critical role in the criminal process, especially with the rise in the use of psychiatric expert evidence in criminal cases. It is crucial to ensure that the standards of objectivity and competence expected of expert witnesses are met consistently.

{:start=“3”}
3.&nbsp;The establishment of the Panel will better safeguard the objectivity and quality of such evidence.

{:start=“4”}
4.&nbsp;The key features of the Panel are as follows:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) A Selection Committee comprising a Judge of the Supreme Court, District Judge and an officer from the Ministry of Health will decide on the appointment of psychiatrists to the Panel. The full list of eligibility criteria is available in the <b><u>Annex</u></b> below.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) Psychiatrists must be admitted to the Panel before they can give psychiatric expert evidence in criminal proceedings.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">c) There will be an avenue of appeal for psychiatrists whose applications are rejected.</p>

{:start=“5”}
5.&nbsp;The Panel’s website will also provide a central and public directory of all the appointed members. This will allow increased visibility for the listed psychiatrists, and greater choice for lawyers looking to engage a psychiatrist.

{:start=“6”}
6.&nbsp;We strongly encourage all qualified psychiatrists who may be required to give psychiatric expert evidence in criminal proceedings to apply for appointment <b><u>between 31 December 2025 and 28 February 2026</u></b><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.

<b>Rules relating to expert reports and evidence</b>

{:start=“7”}
7.&nbsp;The Criminal Procedure (Expert Opinion) Rules 2025 will also provide for the following:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) <b>Duties of an expert to the Court</b>, including that the expert’s duty to the Court will override any obligation an expert would have towards a party<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) <b>Requirements relating to expert reports</b>, such as codifying the basic requirements for expert reports<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">c) <b>The Court’s power to order concurrent expert evidence or “hot-tubbing” with the consent of the parties</b>, which will allow more than one expert witness to testify before the Court at the same time, even if they are engaged by different parties. This will assist the Court to assess expert evidence more effectively and focus on areas of disagreement, especially in cases involving complex technical issues.</p>
