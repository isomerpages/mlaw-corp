1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Convention Week (SC Week) 2023 will return on 28 August to 1 September this year. This follows a successful SC Week 2022, which saw over 4,000 participants from more than 100 countries. The event will bring together thought leaders, experts, practitioners and policy makers from the legal, business, and government sectors to share the latest developments, discuss emerging trends, and exchange insights in cross-border dispute resolution amidst an ever-changing global landscape.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organised by the Singapore Ministry of Law (MinLaw), in collaboration with supporting partner organisations, SC Week 2023 features an extensive line-up of events on dispute resolution, including panel discussions, workshops, debates, lectures, networking events, and visits. It consists of:
<br>
<br>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **The UNCITRAL Academy**: The UNCITRAL Academy, which comprises a Conference and Capacity-Building Workshops, is the headline event of the SC Week. It will be jointly organised by MinLaw and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) on 29 to 31 August 2023 (see&nbsp;**Annex A** for the programme on 29 August 2023).
<br>
<br>Centred around the theme _‘Tomorrow’s World Today: Leading the Future of Dispute Resolution’_, the UNCITRAL Academy provides a platform for international and local experts to discuss current and emerging global issues. These include the ever-evolving digital economy, inter-cultural needs in mediation and arbitration, in the rise of mediation in investor-State dispute settlement, dispute resolution for carbon markets, the effects of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and more.
<br>
<br>Singapore’s Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, and Second Minister for Law Mr Edwin Tong SC will open the UNCITRAL Academy Conference and Industry Capacity-Building Workshop with a welcome address. This will be followed by opening remarks by Ms Anna Joubin-Bret, Secretary of UNCITRAL. About 30 global experts in various fields will share their insights and analysis in the subsequent panel discussions, fireside chat and workshop.
<br>
<br>The three UNCITRAL Academy Capacity-Building Workshops will comprise presentations by and panel discussions with international dispute resolution experts, practitioners, and Government officials. Of these, two Workshops are closed-door sessions catered for Government officials only, while the Industry Capacity-Building Workshop is open to all attendees. With a demonstration and real-life case studies, the Industry Capacity-Building Workshop will provide a deep-dive into mediation advocacy, with practical tips on maximising mediation to resolve disputes.
