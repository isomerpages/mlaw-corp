1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) today launched a public consultation to gather public feedback on proposed amendments to the Trustees Act. The public consultation will run until 31 January 2017.


2. The proposed amendments underline Singapore’s commitment as a responsible member of the international community to global efforts in countering money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion.


3. As a member of the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) and Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (“GF”), Singapore takes reference from international standards set by these bodies. The proposed amendments seek to give effect to the FATF recommendations and GF requirements, by enhancing the transparency of the ownership and control structures of trusts, and prescribing minimum standards for financial record keeping by trustees.

<li>The proposed amendments to the Trustees Act include provisions to empower the Minister to make rules to:

<li>Designate any breach of such rules as an offence; and</li>
<li>Impose a penalty of a fine not exceeding $1,000 for any breaches of the obligations.</li>

**Background**
