<ol start="1">
<li> The Government announced today temporary relief measures for property developers and individuals affected by disruptions to construction timelines and sales of housing units resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular the implementation of the circuit breaker from 7 April to 1 June 2020. The Government will continue to ensure that prices for private residential properties remain broadly consistent with economic fundamentals. Hence, these temporary relief measures do not alter the other existing residential property market cooling measures. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li> The temporary relief measures, to be implemented with immediate effect, are:

<br><br>a. Extension of the Project Completion Period (PCP) by 6 months for residential, commercial and industrial development projects;

<br><br>b. Extension of time by 6 months for the commencement and completion of residential development, and sale of housing units in residential development projects in relation to the remission of the Additional Buyer's Stamp Duty (ABSD) for housing developers;<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

<br><br>c. Extension of the PCP and/or disposal period by up to a total of 6 months for residential development projects under the Qualifying Certificate (QC) regime for foreign housing developers; and

<br><br>d. Extension of time by 6 months for the sale of the first residential property in relation to the remission of ABSD for the second residential property purchased by a Singaporean married couple.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li> The COVID-19 pandemic, and associated public health measures imposed by governments around the world, have disrupted supply chains and created manpower shortages. The circuit breaker measures put in place from 7 April 2020 also saw the suspension of work at construction sites, operations at housing developers' sales galleries, and home viewings. This has affected construction timelines and the sale of housing units. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li> All housing developers, as well as Singaporean married couples who wish to seek ABSD remission for their second residential properties, will continue to be subject to the prevailing ABSD regime, albeit with an increase in the remission condition timelines for qualifying developers and Singaporean married couples. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li> The Government expects developers to similarly provide relief and support to their main contractors, especially during the circuit breaker period when the progress of work is disrupted. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li> The Government will continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the progress of work within the construction industry, and on the property sector, and will adjust our policies as necessary. </li>
</ol>

<br><br>a. 6 months after the date of purchase of the second property, if it is a completed property; or 

<br><br>b. 6 months after the issue date of the Temporary Occupation Permit ("TOP") or Certificate of Statutory Completion ("CSC"), whichever is the earlier, if the second property was uncompleted at the time of purchase.
