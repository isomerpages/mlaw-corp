1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 16 October 2025, the Ministry of Law (“**MinLaw**”) launched a public consultation to seek feedback on the recommendations by the Committee to Review the Regulatory Framework for Law Practices and Collaborations in Singapore (the “**Committee**”).<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

{:start=“2”}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MinLaw is extending the public consultation period by 5 weeks, to 14 January 2026.&nbsp; MinLaw has been receiving a range of useful comments and feedback from the legal industry since the consultation began. The extension will provide stakeholders with additional time to review the Committee’s report in detail and submit feedback, while allowing MinLaw to continue its ongoing engagements with stakeholders.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of 24 November 2025, MinLaw has engaged nearly 80 foreign law practices regarding the Committee’s report, and continues to engage other segments of the legal industry including Singapore law practices. These engagements will continue to January 2026.
