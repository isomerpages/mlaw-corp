It is the fifth edition, and also an apt occasion to mark the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and China. In an increasingly fragmented world, collaboration among like-minded partners has become ever more important. We deeply value our longstanding friendship with China and look forward to further strengthening our cooperation in the legal sector in the years ahead”.

It is a concrete implementation to forge consensus and explore effective pathways for properly resolving international commercial disputes. It is an important platform for deepening the exchange in the international rule of law and enhancing the influence of China and Singapore in the field of commercial dispute resolution.”
