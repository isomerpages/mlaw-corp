1.&nbsp;The Ministry of Law (“<b>MinLaw</b>”) has carefully considered feedback received from the public consultation on the framework for remote witnessing and electronic signing of statutory declarations<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, and issued a response to the feedback today.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;The public consultation was held from 5 July to 2 August 2024<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, and received a total of 35 responses. MinLaw would like to thank all respondents for their feedback and suggestions. MinLaw will work with the Singapore Academy of Law (“<b>SAL</b>”) to implement the framework in a manner that addresses the feedback.

<b>Summary of Feedback Received</b>

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;A summary of the feedback received and MinLaw’s response is set out below.

<i>Remote Witnessing</i>

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;Most respondents agreed that the proposed statutory requirements strike an appropriate balance between convenience and efficiency, and ensuring the integrity of the process. A few respondents noted the need for safeguards to address potential risks of fraud or undue influence and ensure the integrity of the document being signed. Some respondents also noted issues that service providers might face – lack of familiarity with technology, potential administrative burden, and the need for proper record-keeping.

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;MinLaw will work closely with SAL to address these concerns. Before the framework is operationalised, SAL will update the Manuals applicable to the various service providers. These updated Manuals will amongst others, provide guidance on record-keeping and on how to verify the identity and location of the declarant. MinLaw will also work with SAL on a sample jurat for use during remote witnessing.

<i>Electronic Signing</i>

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;On the proposed “hybrid” approach for electronic signing, respondents who were supportive noted that it offered a balance by allowing for flexibility and efficiency while also ensuring adequate security safeguards through the use of Singpass<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. However, some respondents preferred to require both declarants and service providers to sign statutory declarations using Sign with Singpass as this would reduce the risk of fraud.

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;MinLaw, in consultation with SAL, will adopt the “hybrid” approach. There is little risk of fraud and document tampering after the service provider signs the document given that the service provider is required to use Sign with Singpass. The “hybrid” approach will also allow declarants without Singpass accounts, as well as those who are less technologically savvy, to sign the document.

<b>Overarching duty to Exercise Care, Skill and Diligence</b>

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;Even as remote witnessing is made available as an option for service providers and their clients, in-person witnessing will continue to remain available. Service providers are bound by an overarching duty to exercise due care, skill and diligence. Should they have doubts as to the authenticity of the document, suspect potential fraud, or assess that remote witnessing would not be suitable for the circumstances of a specific case, they should put a stop to the remote witnessing and call for in-person witnessing instead. This duty will be reinforced in the respective Manuals for service providers that are published by SAL to help service providers mitigate potential risks.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;MinLaw and SAL will continue to monitor the implementation of the new framework and work closely with the industry after the framework is implemented, to ensure that safeguards are appropriate and kept up-to-date.

<p></p><p><sup id="fn1">1.&nbsp;A statutory declaration is a written statement that a person signs, and solemnly declares to be true. It has to be made before an authorised service provider, such as a Commissioner for Oaths. This is an in-person, paper-based process and usually involves the use of wet-ink signatures.</sup><a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text." style="font-size: 12px">↩</a></p>

<p></p><p><sup id="fn3">3.&nbsp;In the proposed “hybrid” approach, declarants may sign the statutory declaration using any electronic signature, including an ordinary electronic signature or a secure electronic signature. They will, however, be encouraged to use Sign with Singpass. On the other hand, the service provider administering the statutory declaration must use Sign with Singpass.</sup><a href="#ref3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text." style="font-size: 12px">↩</a></p>
