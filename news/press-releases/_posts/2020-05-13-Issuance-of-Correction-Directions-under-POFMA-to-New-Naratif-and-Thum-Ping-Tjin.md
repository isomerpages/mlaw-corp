1. In a recent video posted on the New Naratif YouTube channel, Mr Thum Ping Tjin made several false and misleading statements on the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). Correction Directions under POFMA have been issued to New Naratif and Mr Thum in respect of these falsehoods on 13 May 2020.

2. Under these Correction Directions, a correction notice must be placed alongside the video. The correction notice provides a link to the facts and the Governmentâ€™s clarifications on the matter (<a href="http://www.gov.sg/article/factually-corrections-on-falsehoods-about-pofma-by-thum-ping-tjin">http://www.gov.sg/article/factually-corrections-on-falsehoods-about-pofma-by-thum-ping-tjin</a>).

3. The video itself will remain fully accessible to the public. Thus, members of the public will be in a position to view the video, read the correction notice and clarifications, and come to their own conclusions.
