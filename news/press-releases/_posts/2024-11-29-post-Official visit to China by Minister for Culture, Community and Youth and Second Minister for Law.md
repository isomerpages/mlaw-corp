2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the visit, Minister Tong attended the 4th Singapore-China International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference (“ICDRC”) in Beijing on 27 November as the Singapore Guest-of-Honour. The ICDRC is an annual conference, jointly organised by Singapore’s Ministry of Law (“MinLaw”) and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (“CCPIT”). Since its inaugural edition in 2019, the Conference has become a key platform for legal practitioners, businesses, government officials, and academics from Singapore and China, to discuss how our two countries can work together to help businesses resolve cross-border commercial disputes in a fair, efficient, and effective manner.

Minister said that both countries should build on the strong ties fostered over the years, and explore new areas for collaboration. These efforts will help to support the economic development of our countries and bring mutual benefits, Minister said.
