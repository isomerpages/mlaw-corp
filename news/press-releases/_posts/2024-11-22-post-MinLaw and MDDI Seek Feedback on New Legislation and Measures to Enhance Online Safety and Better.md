1.&nbsp;The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Ministry of Digital Development and&nbsp; Information (MDDI) launched a public consultation today to seek feedback on&nbsp; proposed legislation and measures to enhance online safety. The proposals&nbsp; target to enable victims of online harms to obtain assistance, and increase the&nbsp; accountability of those who are responsible for online harms.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;The public consultation will run for one month, until 22 December 2024.

<b>Background</b>

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;Harmful online content and conduct continue to affect many in Singapore and&nbsp; around the world. At the launch of Smart Nation 2.0 on 1 October 2024, Prime&nbsp; Minister Lawrence Wong announced that the Government would introduce new&nbsp; legislation and measures to provide stronger assurance to victims, including&nbsp; setting up a dedicated agency to improve protection for them.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;These proposals form part of the Governmentâ€™s commitment to tackling online  harms and will enable victims to remedy the damage suffered from online  harms. They will also help shape the norms of acceptable online conduct and  improve accountability among members of the online ecosystem. These  proposals complement our existing regulatory framework and the criminal  justice system.

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;In summary, the proposed reforms will: 

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a.&nbsp;Introduce a <u>complaints mechanism</u>, administered by the new agency to  provide timely assistance to victims of online harms.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b.&nbsp;Introduce <u>statutory torts</u> for various online harms, to provide legal certainty  should victims of online harms choose to pursue redress against  responsible parties in court to hold them accountable through liability for  online harms.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">c.&nbsp;Increase accountability through improved user information disclosure.</p>
