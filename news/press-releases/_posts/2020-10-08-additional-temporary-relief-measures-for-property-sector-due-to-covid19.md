{:start="1"}
1. The Government announced today additional temporary relief measures for property developers affected by disruptions to construction timelines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This is in addition to the temporary relief measures announced  on 6 May 2020. These temporary relief measures do not affect the other existing  residential property market cooling measures which remain relevant to ensure that private residential property prices are broadly consistent with economic fundamentals. 

{:start="2"}
2. The additional temporary relief measures, to be implemented with immediate effect, are:
 <br><br>   i. Extension of the Project Completion Period (PCP) by a further 6 months for residential, commercial and industrial development projects;
<br><br>    ii. Extension of time by a further 6 months for the commencement and completion of the residential development projects in relation to the remission of the Additional Buyer’s Stamp Duty (ABSD) for housing developers<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>; and
<br><br>    iii. Extension of the PCP by up to a further 6 months for residential development projects under the Qualifying Certificate (QC) regime for foreign housing developers.

{:start="3"}
3. While almost all construction projects have restarted, the full resumption of on-site operations remains a challenge with workers being placed under quarantine if they have come in close contact with a positive COVID-19 case, and worksite practices requiring redesign for safe distancing. These public health measures are necessary to prevent the industry from going into lockdown again, but they continue to affect construction timelines.  

{:start="4"}
4. All qualifying housing developers will continue to be subject to the prevailing ABSD regime, albeit with a further 6-month extension of the remission condition timelines for commencement and completion of the residential development projects. There is no further extension of the remission condition timeline for the sale of all housing units in the residential development project. 

{:start="5"}
5. Contractors and developers have raised concerns regarding the additional costs and financial penalties in contracts between stakeholders that may be incurred as a result of delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With these additional support measures, the Government expects developers to continue to similarly provide relief and support to their main contractors. The Government will also continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the progress of work within the construction industry, and on the property sector. The Government will implement additional relief measures to support the stakeholders as necessary, and ensure that no stakeholder bears an undue share of the burden imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

<b>Private Residential Development Projects</b>
