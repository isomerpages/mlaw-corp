1.&nbsp;Senior Parliamentary Secretary (Law and Social and Family Development) Mr Eric Chua and Ms Peggy Yee, Founding Director of PYLegal LLC and advocate for persons with invisible needs, such as disabilities and mental health conditions, will co-chair the newly launched Inclusive Justice Taskforce.

{:start=“2”}
2.&nbsp;The taskforce brings together a diverse group of members from public agencies and private sector partners which demonstrates the wide-ranging support for this initiative. Members include lawyers, policymakers, law enforcement officers, social service professionals, healthcare experts, and community partners. (See [Annex](/files/Annex_List_of_Inclusive_Justice_Taskforce_members.pdf) for list of taskforce members.)

{:start=“3”}
3.&nbsp;The taskforce has been launched following Minister (Law) and Second Minister (Home Affairs) Mr Edwin Tong SC's endorsement of Ms Yee's call for an inter-agency approach to better assist persons with "invisible disabilities" in the criminal justice system. Minister Tong had agreed to this initiative at the inaugural Access to Justice Symposium on 26 March 2025.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

4.&nbsp;Under the co-chairmanship of SPS Mr Eric Chua and Ms Yee, the taskforce will examine how the Government can better support individuals with disabilities and mental health conditions who are at risk of offending or may interact with Singapore's criminal justice system, including accused persons and victims.

{:start=“5”}
5.&nbsp;Taskforce members will examine the entire criminal justice process, from the pre-offending stage and criminal investigations to court processes, sentencing and post-sentencing support measures. 

{:start=“6”}
6.&nbsp;They will also take stock of the existing measures, identify areas for improvement, and propose potential reforms for the Government to consider implementing. 

{:start=“7”}
7.&nbsp;Mr Eric Chua, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Social and Family Development said, “I am privileged to be co-chairing the Inclusive Justice Taskforce with Peggy as part of our commitment to building a more inclusive society. The Taskforce will examine how our community and the criminal justice system can better support individuals with disabilities and mental health conditions. We have assembled a strong collaborative team of legal practitioners, policymakers, social service agencies, and healthcare professionals. It will also include advocates for the disability and special needs community, to represent their voices. Work will be done to review current practices, identify gaps, and develop recommendations to address them.” 

{:start=“8”}
8.&nbsp;Ms Peggy Yee said, “Individuals with mental health conditions and disabilities are often unable to advocate for themselves and would benefit from dedicated support in navigating the justice system. I am grateful to be co-chairing the Taskforce with SPS Eric Chua. We look forward to working with the Taskforce members to co-create practical solutions that support vulnerable individuals with empathy and fairness as they interact with the criminal justice system, whether they are accused persons, victims or witnesses.” 

{:start=“9”}
9.&nbsp;The Taskforce reflects the Government’s commitment to partner with individuals from the private sector and the community to co-create solutions to benefit our society, including better support for vulnerable individuals with disabilities and mental health conditions. This initiative aligns with the spirit of SGLAW 200, as Singapore continues to strengthen its legal system and ensure justice remains accessible to all members of society.
