1.	The Ministry of Law (**“MinLaw”**), in consultation with relevant Ministries and agencies, has further extended the duration of legislation that enables entities to hold meetings via electronic means, beyond 30 June 2021. Such legislation will continue to be in force until revoked or amended by MinLaw. This will provide entities with greater legal certainty to plan their meetings, and the option to hold virtual meetings to minimise physical interactions, amid the COVID-19 situation. 

Background

2.	The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings) Orders (the **“Meetings Orders”**) enable various types of entities to convene, hold or conduct meetings through electronic means, even if this is not allowed under the written law or legal instrument which provides for the meeting.

3.	MinLaw had earlier announced that the Meetings Orders would apply for the period starting on 27 March 2020 and ending on 30 June 2021. 

Duration of the Meetings Orders

4.	With the amendments, the Meetings Orders will now extend beyond 30 June 2021, until they are revoked or amended by MinLaw. It is envisaged that the Meetings Orders will continue to be in force for at least as long as the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 (the **“Control Order”**) is in force.  

5.	To provide certainty to entities organising meetings, MinLaw will give at least 6 months’ advance notice before the alternative arrangements cease to be available. This will cater to entities who have relied on a Meetings Order to make early preparations for meetings, before the end date is announced.

6.	For further information and enquiries, entities may check the websites of or approach their respective regulators. A list of guidance notes and regulators’ contact information can be found at https://www.go.gov.sg/alternativemeetings.
