4. On the same day, SMS Tong will deliver a Japan Association of Arbitrators (JAA) Memorial Lecture on the Singapore Convention on Mediation. In December 2018, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to adopt the United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation and to name it after Singapore.

Japan Vice Minister of Justice, Hiroyuki Tsuji, will deliver the opening address. This is the first high-level legal conference jointly organised by Singapore and Japan. It brings together 200 government officials, business executives, inhouse counsel, legal practitioners and academics, to discuss how Singapore and Japanese businesses, lawyers and dispute resolution institutions can work together to capture opportunities in a new Asian century.

 

7. SMS Tong will have a roundtable discussion with four of Japan’s largest law firms, Anderson Mori & Tomotsune, Mori Hamada & Matsumoto, Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu and Nishimura & Asahi, to discuss how Japanese law firms can better support their clients in Singapore and the region, including through cooperation with the Singapore law practices.

 

8. SMS Tong will also visit the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which provides technical and financial assistance for infrastructure projects, to discuss how Singapore and Japan can deepen collaboration on infrastructure projects, including through the use of the Infrastructure Asia Office and the Singapore Infrastructure Dispute-Management Protocol which Singapore launched in October 2018.

 

9. On 13 March, SMS Tong will visit Doshisha University, one of the oldest and leading private universities in Japan’s Kansai region, and the Japan International Mediation Centre in Kyoto (JIMC-Kyoto).

SMS Tong will visit the Kodaiji Temple, a mediation venue for parties using JIMC-Kyoto.
