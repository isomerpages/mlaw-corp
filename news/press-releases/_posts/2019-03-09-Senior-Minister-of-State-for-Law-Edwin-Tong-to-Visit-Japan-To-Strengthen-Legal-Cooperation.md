7. SMS Tong will have a roundtable discussion with four of Japan’s largest law firms, Anderson Mori & Tomotsune, Mori Hamada & Matsumoto, Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu and Nishimura & Asahi, to discuss how Japanese law firms can better support their clients in Singapore and the region, including through cooperation with the Singapore law practices.

 

8. SMS Tong will also visit the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which provides technical and financial assistance for infrastructure projects, to discuss how Singapore and Japan can deepen collaboration on infrastructure projects, including through the use of the Infrastructure Asia Office and the Singapore Infrastructure Dispute-Management Protocol which Singapore launched in October 2018.
