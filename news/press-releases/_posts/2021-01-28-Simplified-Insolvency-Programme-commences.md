1. Micro and small companies (“<b>MSCs</b>”)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> which have been severely impacted by COVID-19 and require support to restructure their debts to rehabilitate their business or wind up may apply for the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“<b>SIP</b>”) from 29 January 2021<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>.

{:start="2"}
2. The SIP will provide simpler, faster, and lower-cost restructuring and insolvency proceedings for eligible MSCs and complements existing insolvency processes in the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act.

{:start="3"}
3. The SIP will be available for application for a period of 6 months from 29 January 2021 to 28 July 2021. This period may be further extended should the need arise.

{:start="4"}
4. The SIP comprises two separate programmes which eligible MSCs may apply for:<br>
<br>
    a. Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“<b>SDRP</b>”) – For the restructuring of debts and potential rehabilitation of viable businesses; and
    
    b. Simplified Winding Up Programme (“<b>SWUP</b>”) – For the orderly winding up of non-viable businesses.
    
{:start="5"}
5. The SIP will be administered by the Official Receiver (“<b>OR</b>”), who may assign private insolvency practitioners to administer the MSCs accepted into the SIP.

<u>Requirements for Acceptance into the SIP</u>

{:start="6"}
6. To qualify for the SIP, MSCs must meet the following eligibility criteria<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>:<br>

<u>Other Support Measures</u>

{:start="9"}
9. Besides the SIP, non-corporate businesses may also tap on the Sole Proprietors and Partnerships (“<b>SPP</b>”) Scheme<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> administered by Credit Counselling Singapore, as well as the support measures introduced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> to help Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (“<b>SMEs</b>”) deal with their short term cashflow difficulties. 
    
{:start="10"}
10. The SIP forms part of a suite of Government measures to help businesses and our workforce emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. It complements the existing COVID-19 relief measures and legal remedies, including the Re-Align Framework, which allows small and micro businesses to renegotiate their contracts and which commenced on 15 January 2021.
