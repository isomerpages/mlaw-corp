1. The Community Mediation Centre (CMC) received international accreditation for its community mediation service and training, as it turns 20 this year. At its annual Mediators’ Appointment Ceremony and Appreciation Dinner this evening, Senior Minister of State (SMS) for Law and Health Edwin Tong, thanked the CMC’s volunteer mediators for their contributions. He also gave out the Minister for Law Community Mediator Award, the top honour given to volunteer mediators for their contribution to community mediation in Singapore.

2. In his address, SMS Tong said, “The international accreditation is a major milestone for the CMC. It is an important acknowledgement of the quality of the CMC’s mediation service and also the skills and standards of our mediators. The CMC would not be where it is today without the tireless efforts of our volunteer mediators.”

3. Set up in 1998 as a department under the Ministry of Law, the CMC provides an accessible, affordable and effective means for resolving community disputes. Over the last 20 years, it has mediated more than 9,000 cases; more than 70% were successfully resolved. The CMC taps on volunteers to mediate these cases. The number of volunteer mediators on the CMC’s panel has grown from 47 in 1998 to 153 in 2018.

4. At the dinner, SMS Tong announced that the CMC has achieved accreditation by the Singapore International Mediation Institute (SIMI), the professional standards body for mediation in Singapore and the region. With this accreditation, both CMC’s community mediation service and training are now recognised as meeting international standards. Moving forward, the accreditation will allow the CMC to train and accredit its own mediators under SIMI’s accreditation framework.
