1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) has formed an advisory committee on moneylending to review the moneylending regulatory regime and recommend suitable measures to strengthen the framework.

2. The 15-member committee is chaired by Mr Manu Bhaskaran, Director of Centennial Group International and Vice President of the Economics Society of Singapore, and includes representatives from the moneylending industry as well as voluntary welfare organisations which help distressed borrowers.  A full list of the committee members is in [Annex A (0.14MB)](/files/news/press-releases/2014/06/Moneylending Advisory Committee.pdf).

<li>Restricting the charging of fees by moneylenders;</li>
