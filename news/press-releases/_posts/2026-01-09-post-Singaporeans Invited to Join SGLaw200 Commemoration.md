1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singaporeans are invited to join in the commemoration of SGLaw200 – the bicentennial anniversary of Singapore’s modern legal system – through a series of events in 2026. Senior Minister of State for Law and Transport, Mr Murali Pillai SC, announced this at the 37th Singapore Law Review Annual Lecture on 9 January 2026 at the National University of Singapore.

**The Significance of SGLaw200**

{:start=“2”}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SGLaw200 marks 200 years since the Second Charter of Justice was enacted in 1826. This landmark document established our modern judicial and legal system, introducing a common set of laws for all residents, regardless of race, culture, or religion – this is the essence of the Rule of Law, which is a principle that remains fundamental to Singapore today.

{:start=“3”}
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Singapore gained independence, our founding fathers had the foresight to recognise that we needed to evolve the colonial laws and institutions we inherited to benefit our young nation. They championed our legal system and the Rule of Law as key tenets of nation-building. They also recognised that having a sound legal framework was not enough: the Rule of Law must be implemented in a pragmatic manner to deliver concrete results to benefit and serve the common good of society.

{:start=“4”}
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach has served Singapore well thus far. It has driven our economic success, maintained racial and religious harmony and provided a strong foundation for the development of key social policies. Amidst global volatility, Singapore remains a safe and stable nation committed to the Rule of Law – where individuals can maximise their potential, families can thrive, and businesses can grow. The trust and recognition of Singapore’s legal system have also established Singapore as a leading dispute resolution hub.

{:start=“5”}
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rule of Law has also ensured that no one is above the law, and fundamental rights are respected and protected. Driven by these key principles, Government agencies, the Judiciary, the broader legal fraternity, and other community partners have worked together to provide access to justice for Singaporeans across different legal needs and income levels. Vulnerable groups are also protected through specific laws and specialised legal processes.

{:start=“6”}
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, laws and legal frameworks are not, and should not be, cast in stone. SGLaw200 is also an opportunity to look ahead to the future — and how the next generation must continue to strengthen and evolve the Rule of Law to meet new challenges, fulfil emerging needs, and reflect the values of the time.

**Programme Details**

{:start=“7”}
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To commemorate SGLaw200, the key stakeholders in the legal system – including the Ministry of Law, the Judiciary, the Attorney-General’s Chambers, the Singapore Academy of Law, the Law Society of Singapore, the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association and the law schools<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> – have come together to organise various events and activities for youths, the legal industry, and the public at large. Other supporting partners include the National Heritage Board, the People’s Association, the Institute of Policy Studies, the National Youth Council, and the National Library Board.

{:start=“8”}
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some key events that members of the public can look forward to in the coming year include the SGLaw200 Youth Forum in May 2026, as well as a heritage trail and a roving exhibition in the heartlands to highlight the significance of the Rule of Law to the community from the second half of 2026.
