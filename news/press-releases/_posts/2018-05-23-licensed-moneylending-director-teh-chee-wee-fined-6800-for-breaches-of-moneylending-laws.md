23 May 2018 Posted in [Press releases](/news/press-releases)

1. The Registry of Moneylenders, a department under the Ministry of Law, brought charges in the State Courts on 18 December 2017 against Teh Chee Wee (郑 志 威), 42 years old, the director of the moneylending company, RTG Credit (S) Pte Ltd.

 

2. RTG Credit (S) Pte Ltd held a moneylending licence since 6 December 2013.

 

3. On 14 May 2018, Teh pleaded guilty in the State Courts and was convicted on five out of 16 charges for the following offences:

 

* Four charges under section 21(7) read with section 21(1) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) for having failed to supply a statement of accounts to borrowers for loans which were subsisting.
* One charge under rule 16(3) read with rules 16(2)(c)(ii) and 14(2)(c) of the Moneylenders Rules 2009 and section 24(1)(a) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) for having failed to keep the loan account book in such a manner that every amount of repayment paid to the account was appropriated in the book to the principal sum, the amount of interest and the permitted fees.

4. Teh was sentenced in the State Courts on 21 May 2018 to a total fine of $6,800, (in default 4 weeks’ and 4 days’ imprisonment).

5. Forty-six licensed moneylenders or their officers have been convicted and fined for offences under the Moneylenders Act and Rules (“MLA/R”) since 2011 (see **<u>Annex</u>**).

 
{:start="6"}
6. Strict compliance with the MLA/R ensures that loan agreements are entered into in a proper and transparent manner. Giving a statement of accounts to borrowers for outstanding loans ensures that the borrowers are kept abreast of their loan account status. In addition to that, moneylenders will also avoid potential disputes with borrowers on the repayable amount. In essence, these practices protect the interests of both borrowers and licensed moneylenders. The Registry reminds all licensed moneylenders to adhere to these requirements at all times.

 
{:start="7"}
7. The Registry carries out regular inspections on licensed moneylenders. Where breaches of moneylending laws are found, enforcement measures are taken, including the suspension or revocation of licences, forfeiture of security deposits, warnings and prosecutions. Those convicted of breaches of the MLA/R face a fine of up to $40,000 and/or an imprisonment term of up to two years on each charge.
