{:start="1"}
1.	The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings) Orders (the “**Meetings Orders**”), which enable various types of entities to convene, hold or conduct meetings through electronic means, will cease on 1 July 2023.

<b><u>Background</u></b>

{:start="2"}
2.	Introduced in April 2020 as part of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020, the Meetings Orders provide entities with the temporary option to hold virtual meetings, even if this is not allowed under the written law or legal instrument which provides for the meeting. This has enabled entities to continue to convene, hold and conduct meetings, while minimising physical interactions and transmission risks amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
    
{:start="3"}
3.	The Meetings Orders were originally supposed to expire on 30 September 2020. However, in view of the continuing COVID-19 situation then, the Ministry of Law (“**MinLaw**”) extended the Meetings Orders beyond 30 September 2020, until such time they are revoked or amended by MinLaw<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.

<b><u>End of Meeting Orders</u></b>

{:start="4"}
4.	Singapore has progressively transitioned towards living with COVID-19, and meetings can now take place physically. MinLaw, in consultation with relevant Ministries and agencies, will revoke the Meetings Orders on 1 July 2023.

{:start="5"}
5.	This gives entities six months’ advance notice to resume meeting arrangements in accordance with written law or their governing instruments.

6.	For further information and enquiries, entities may check the websites of or approach their respective regulators. A list of guidance notes and regulators’ contact information can be found at [https://www.go.gov.sg/alternativemeetings](https://www.go.gov.sg/alternativemeetings).
