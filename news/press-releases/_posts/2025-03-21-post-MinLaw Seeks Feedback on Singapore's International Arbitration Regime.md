<p>1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) launched a public consultation today to
seek feedback on Singapore’s international arbitration regime and the International
Arbitration Act 1994 of Singapore (IAA).</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. The public consultation will run for six weeks, ending on 2 May 2025.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>International Arbitration Act 1994</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. The IAA, which first came into force in 1995, adopts the UNCITRAL Model
Law on International Commercial Arbitration (1985) (Model Law) to provide
a legal framework for international arbitration proceedings. Singapore
regularly reviews the IAA, and introduces revisions to update the legislation
where necessary.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Study on Singapore’s international arbitration regime and the IAA</strong>
<p></p>
<p>4. Singapore is widely regarded as a global legal hub and one of the world’s
leading international arbitration hubs. To strengthen our international
arbitration regime and maintain our competitiveness in the international
sphere, MinLaw keeps abreast of international best practices and commercial
developments to ensure that our policies and legislation remain relevant
in the face of evolving industry needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. As part of this continual review, MinLaw commissioned the Singapore
International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA) to conduct a study on
Singapore’s international arbitration regime and the IAA. A report of SIDRA’s
study, published on 21 March, can be found at <a href="https://sidra.smu.edu.sg/research-program/review-of-the-singapore-international-arbitration-act-2024/agenda" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://sidra.smu.edu.sg/research-program/review-of-the-singapore-international-arbitration-act-2024/agenda</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. In addition to the SIDRA study, MinLaw also engaged various stakeholders,
including practitioners and dispute resolution institutions, to obtain
their feedback and suggestions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Public Consultation</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. In addition to the consultation efforts thus far, MinLaw is seeking
views from members of the public on Singapore’s international arbitration
regime and the IAA, including in relation to setting aside applications
and other post-award scenarios. The full public consultation paper may
be viewed online at <a href="https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/public-consultation-on-the-international-arbitration-act-1994-of-singapore/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/public-consultation-on-the-international-arbitration-act-1994-of-singapore/</a>.</p>
<p></p>

above as well as any other feedback on how Singapore’s international arbitration
framework can be improved to better support the needs of the users. All
views and feedback may be submitted at the following link by 2 May 2025:
