1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and Maxwell Chambers, in collaboration with the Secretariat of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), hosted an evening event on Saturday, 9 June 2012 in Maxwell Chambers, Singapore to launch the first published UNCITRAL Digest on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. Singapore is privileged and honoured to be the first country to hold such a launch event for this publication.

2. The event was graced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law, Mr K Shanmugam, who officiated the launch. Speaking to guests at the event, Minister Shanmugam expressed hopes that the launch event would mark the beginning of a deeper relationship between UNCITRAL and Singapore. To commemorate the official launch of the Digest, Mr Salim Moollan, Chair of UNCITRAL of the 44th session (2011 – 2012) presented a copy of the Digest to Minister Shanmugam.

3. Mr Renaud Sorieul, the Secretary of UNCITRAL, spoke on the importance of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and explained the history and purpose of the Digest. To-date, the UNCITRAL Model Law has been adopted by 90 jurisdictions around the world. The widespread adoption of the Model Law has led to the need for uniform interpretation of its provisions which the Digest, a compilation of cases from 37 States, aims to facilitate.

4. More than 90 representatives from local and foreign law firms and arbitral bodies such as the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), Singapore Chamber of Maritime Association (SCMA), Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), ICC International Court of Arbitration, American Arbitration Association (AAA) and the International Federation of Commercial Arbitration Institutions (IFCAI) attended this launch event.

5. The contributors of the Digest – Professor Lawrence Boo, Dr Stefan Kröll and Mr. Frederic Bachand – led an interactive panel discussion on the contents of the Digest after the launch. Please refer to **<u>Annex A</u>** for the programme of the launch event.
