**Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC)**

**<u>Question:</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law (a) how many black and white bungalows are there in Sembawang managed by SLA; (b) how many are currently rented out; (c) what is the Ministry doing to maintain these bungalows some of which are in a state of disrepair; and (d) whether these bungalows will be preserved as part of our heritage. 

**<u>Answer:</u>**  
1. The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) currently manages 45 black and white bungalows in Sembawang. 29 of them are currently rented out, while 4 units are available for rent as residences. The remaining 12 units are safeguarded for Government agencies which are exploring other uses for these properties.

2. SLA has appointed a managing agent to carry out regular maintenance on all the vacant properties. The maintenance works include housekeeping, grass cutting, tree pruning and vector control.  SLA’s managing agent also carries out painting, building, mechanical, electrical and interior works before the properties are let out, or during tenancy renewals.  Repair works are also carried out when necessary. SLA ensures that none of these properties fall into a state of disrepair.

3. The Government recognizes the heritage value of these bungalows. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) will take this into consideration when studying the future development plans for the area.
