1.	The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) today launched a public consultation that will run for four (4 weeks), ending on 30 June 2020, to seek feedback on a proposed licensing scheme for Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) in Singapore. 

2.	The public consultation is part of the overall review of Singapore’s copyright regime and aims to develop a regulatory framework that is practical, reflects the interests of stakeholders and ensures the efficient transaction of rights in the copyright marketplace.

3.  CMOs manage licensing administration and royalty collection of copyright works for creators, while providing users with cost-effective access to the works. The effective management and access are crucial to the success of any copyright regime. Thus, it is imperative that CMOs operate with high standards of transparency, governance, accountability and efficiency.

4.	CMOs are currently unregulated in Singapore and this public consultation is in response to feedback to address deficiencies that persist in the current CMO ecosystem.
