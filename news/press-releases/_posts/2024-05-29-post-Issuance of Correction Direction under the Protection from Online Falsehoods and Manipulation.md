1. &nbsp; The Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law Mr Edwin Tong has instructed for a Correction Direction, under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), to be issued to Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam in respect of his Facebook post on 25 May 2024. The post contains a false statement of fact.

{:start="2"}
2. &nbsp; The Facebook post states that the Prime Minister and Minister for Law can influence&nbsp; the size of performance bonuses paid to specific High Court Judges. <b>This is untrue</b>:&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
a. &nbsp; Under Article 98(6) of the Constitution, the Legislature shall by law provide for the remuneration of the Supreme Court Judges. The Judges’ Remuneration Act 1994 sets out the framework for the salaries, allowances and privileges accorded to Supreme Court Judges as a class. The annual pensionable salary of Supreme Court Judges as a class is fixed by law.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
b. &nbsp; It is the Chief Justice who then determines the salary and bonuses to be paid to each&nbsp;Supreme Court Judge, within the scope of the framework set out in law.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
c. &nbsp; Neither the Prime Minister nor any Minister can determine or influence the payments to&nbsp;be made to specific Judges under this framework.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
d.&nbsp; Further, the Constitution provides that a Supreme Court Judge’s remuneration and other terms of office shall not be altered to his disadvantage after his appointment.</p>

3. &nbsp; Mr Jeyaretnam’s allegation is thus false.

4. &nbsp; Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam will be required to carry a correction notice, which states that&nbsp;the post contains a false statement of fact and provide a link to the Government’s clarification. This will allow readers to read both versions and draw their own conclusions.&nbsp;
