1.	A  Precious Stones and Precious Metals Regulated Dealer (“PSMD”) will be charged in court on 7 May 2024 for failing to perform the prescribed customer due diligence (“CDD”) measures where the PSMD has reason to suspect money laundering on three occasions between September and October 2023.

2.	Between September and October 2023, the Police received reports of phishing scams involving malware installed on victims’ Android phones and there were unauthorised bank transactions made from victims’ compromised accounts. Further investigations revealed that the monies were linked to three sale transactions between the PSMD and an unidentified person of gold jewellery items and a gold bar amounting to more than $313,000. The PSMD allegedly failed to perform prescribed CDD measures when there was reason to suspect money laundering.
