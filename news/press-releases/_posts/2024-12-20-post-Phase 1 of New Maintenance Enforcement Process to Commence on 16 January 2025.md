{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;A new Maintenance Enforcement Process (“<b>MEP</b>”) will be implemented on 16 January&nbsp;2025. In the first phase of implementation, the new MEP will be available to those who have&nbsp; made one or more previous court applications to enforce payment owed to them under&nbsp; maintenance orders<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. The MEP will be available for other categories of enforcement&nbsp;applications in later phases.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;The new MEP will:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) Deter non-payment of maintenance;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) Make enforcement easier when there is non-payment of maintenance;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">c) Facilitate sustainable maintenance outcomes; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">d) Increase access to justice for applicants, especially those who are self represented.</p>

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;The commencement of Phase 1 of the MEP follows the passing of the Family Justice Reform Act<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> in Parliament on 8 May 2023, as part of the ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Law, the Ministry of Social and Family Development, and the Family Justice Courts (“<b>FJC</b>”) to strengthen therapeutic justice elements in the family justice system and help families in distress to heal and move forward with their lives.

<b>New Unit of Maintenance Enforcement Officers</b>

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;Under the new MEP, applications to enforce payments owed under a maintenance&nbsp;order will be referred to a newly-established Maintenance Enforcement Division (“<b>MED</b>”) sited&nbsp;in the Ministry of Law.

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;Maintenance Enforcement Officers (“<b>MEOs</b>”) from the MED will conduct conciliation to facilitate amicable and sustainable settlement between parties. In conciliation, which replaces&nbsp;the existing mediation process, MEOs will play a more active role in seeking information and&nbsp; recommending solutions to the parties. The MEOs are also empowered to obtain information from the parties and, if necessary, banks and other third parties such as public agencies<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. This&nbsp; will ensure the resolution of the maintenance enforcement application is based on parties’ true financial circumstances.

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;The MEOs will then submit a report to the FJC. With the information provided by the&nbsp;MEOs, the FJC can more accurately determine the parties’ financial circumstances and distinguish between respondents who cannot pay maintenance and those who refuse to pay.&nbsp;This will help the FJC to make more targeted and effective enforcement orders to recover&nbsp;maintenance arrears.

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;The MEOs will also refer suitable parties to financial assistance.

<b>Phase 1 of the MEP</b>

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;During Phase 1, the MEP will apply to eligible repeat maintenance enforcement&nbsp;applications<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;Applicants who wish to enforce a maintenance order can file their applications at the&nbsp;FJC. If this is the first maintenance enforcement application, the MEP will not apply during&nbsp;Phase 1. Instead, the FJC’s existing maintenance enforcement process will apply. The FJC&nbsp;will refer eligible cases with a previous maintenance enforcement application to the MED in&nbsp;Phase 1.

{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp;In Phase 1, respondents undergoing the MEP will be charged a fee of $180 (inclusive&nbsp;of GST) for the MEO’s services. This fee will be reviewed in subsequent phases to ensure&nbsp;alignment with the objectives of the scheme.

{:start="11"}
11.&nbsp;The MEP will be expanded to more categories of maintenance enforcement&nbsp; applications in later phases.

{:start="12"}
12.&nbsp;More information on the new MEP and MED can be found on the MED’s website at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/meo">https://go.gov.sg/meo,</a> as well as in the Annex.
