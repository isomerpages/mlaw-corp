3.	<b>Mr K Shanmugam SC, Singapore’s Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law</b>, said: “There has been increasing demand for practical, efficient and cost-effective cross-border dispute resolution mechanisms. During SC Week 2021, these issues will be discussed. This will be of interest to businesses around the world, particularly in the current times. We are proud to partner UNCITRAL in this effort to make international trade easier for businesses.”

4.	<b>Ms Anna Joubin-Bret, Secretary of UNCITRAL</b>, said: “At the signing ceremony of the Singapore Convention on Mediation in 2019, we had highlighted that signing and ratification were merely the first step towards the promotion of a harmonised framework for international mediation, and that the second and crucial step would be implementation. We are proud to co-organise the inaugural UNCITRAL Academy with MinLaw, and to be a part of SC Week 2021. Such events play an important role in advancing implementation. We hope that these events will help in further increasing awareness and promoting the use of mediation around the world, alongside other dispute resolution processes.”
