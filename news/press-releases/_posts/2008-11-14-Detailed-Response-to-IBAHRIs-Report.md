The Singapore Government issued a detailed response on 14 November 2008 to the International Bar Association Human Rights Institute's (IBAHRI) 72-page Report, which was released on 8 July 2008. This followed the earlier Singapore Government's response issued on 9 July 2008. We note that the IBAHRI's Report has a number of inaccuracies. There are many new points in the Report which were not mentioned in the 20-page draft, that we were previously asked to comment on. A copy of our detailed response to IBAHRI is released for reference.
