1. The Ministry of Law and the Ministry of Social and Family Development were consulted by the Committee for Family Justice on the review of the family justice system in Singapore.

2. The Government welcomes and accepts the recommendations of the Committee for Family Justice. This will realise the vision of a more robust family justice system, which will better protect and support our families.

<ol start="3">
<li>The two key thrusts of the Committee’s key recommendations are to:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Provide better support to help families resolve their disputes through the development of a robust and integrated network of assistance and support; and</li>
<li>Create a comprehensive specialist family court structure known as the Family Justice Courts.  This will introduce enhanced court management processes that will empower the court to adjudicate and resolve family disputes more effectively, while lessening the trauma and acrimony involved in the divorce process.</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li> The Government is committed to implementing the suite of recommendations put forth by the Committee.  This will include the development of the social support framework, and the introduction of a new Family Justice Act in Parliament to establish the Family Justice Courts.</li>
</ol>
