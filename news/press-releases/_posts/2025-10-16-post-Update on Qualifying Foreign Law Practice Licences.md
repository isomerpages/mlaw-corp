1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nine (9) Qualifying Foreign Law Practice (“**QFLP**”) firms in Singapore are: (1) Allen Overy Sherman Sterling; (2) Clifford Chance; (3) Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher; (4) Latham &amp; Watkins; (5) Jones Day; (6) Linklaters; (7) Norton Rose Fulbright; (8) Sidley Austin; and (9) White &amp; Case.&nbsp;

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the completion of a comprehensive review of the overall regulatory framework for law practices and collaborations in Singapore, recommendations were made to ensure that the framework remains fit for purpose, in consideration of the developments and trends in legal services and the future needs of Singapore.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> These included recommendations on changes to the QFLP licence framework.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MinLaw will be studying the recommendations arising from the review, in consultation with the public, and will publish our response in due course.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, the 9 QFLP firms’ licences may be renewed for 2 years (from 1 January 2026 until 31 December 2027). QFLP firms will have the duration to submit their substantive licence renewal applications, taking into consideration (i) any changes to the licencing framework; and (ii) each firm’s strategy as they adapt to the global transformation of the legal industry in recent years. This will also ensure continuity for the QFLPs’ operations in Singapore and provide certainty to their clients. &nbsp;

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The firms’ QFLP licences were last renewed at the end of 2020, for a period of 5 years until end-2025.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> The outcome of the next formal licence renewal exercise will be announced in 2027.

**QFLP Scheme**

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The QFLP scheme was introduced in 2008 following the recommendations of the Committee to Develop the Legal Sector chaired by then Justice V K Rajah and has been in operation since.

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key objectives of the QFLP scheme include growing the legal sector, supporting the growth of Singapore’s key economic sectors, and offering additional opportunities for Singapore-qualified lawyers.

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A QFLP licence allows a foreign law practice to practise Singapore law, except in domestic areas of litigation and general practice, such as criminal law, retail conveyancing, family law and administrative law. The QFLPs can practise the permitted areas of Singapore law through Singapore-qualified lawyers with practising certificates or foreign lawyers holding the foreign practitioner certificate.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The QFLPs have significantly contributed to the growth of Singapore’s legal sector. Between 2021 to 2024, the 9 QFLPs generated over $2 billion in revenue from offshore work. At present, the 9 firms employ over 550 lawyers in their Singapore offices, of which more than 40% are Singapore-qualified lawyers.
