{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;Singapore is a small city-state with limited land. To ensure that the current and future needs of Singaporeans are met, the Government adopts a long-term approach towards our land use planning. This includes ensuring sufficient land to meet critical national needs, such as housing, economic activities, security, and essential infrastructure. Land use plans are continuously reviewed taking into consideration our evolving needs and priorities.

**Golf Course Land**

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;The Government takes a holistic view of land use, in careful consideration of the competing land demands such as housing, economic activities, transport infrastructure and essential services, amongst others. The demand for land for national uses will become more acute in Singapore, and this will impact the amount of land available for golfing over time. The Government will balance the access to golfing facilities by private golf club members and the general public so that there can be golf courses catering to different segments of the golfing community.

**Further Lease Renewals**

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;There are currently 16 golf courses in Singapore, most of which are situated on land with leases that had already been renewed previously (see Annex for the list of golf courses). The leases of these golf courses are for a fixed term, with an end date that is publicly known, to allow both the operators and members of the golf clubs to make informed decisions. This also ensures that land occupied by golf courses can be returned to the State and redeveloped for more pressing national needs in a timely manner. The land reverts to the State when the lease ends.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;The Sentosa Golf Club (Serapong) can be offered a further lease renewal until 31 December 2040, and the National Service Resort &amp; Country Club (Kranji) can be offered a lease renewal until 31 December 2040.

**Balancing Competing Land Use Demands to Benefit the Larger Community**

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;For the other five golf courses with leases expiring before or by 2035, lease renewals cannot be offered as there are future plans for the land in question. These are the Warren Golf &amp; Country Club, Orchid Country Club, Tanah Merah Country Club (Garden), Keppel Club (Sime), and Singapore Island Country Club (Bukit).

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;The tenancy for Mandai Executive Golf Course, which was earlier extended for two years till 31 December 2026, also cannot be further renewed.

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;Of the leases that cannot be renewed, Warren Golf &amp; Country Club and Orchid Country Club’s leases will expire on 31 October 2030 and 31 December 2030 respectively. The land for both courses have been earmarked for residential use in the Draft Master Plan 2025. More details on the future plans for both sites will be shared when ready.

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;The land occupied by Keppel Club (Sime) and Singapore Island Country Club (Bukit) will be reallocated for public golf course use, following the expiry of their leases on 31 December 2030. A part of the site is being considered for allocation to be run by the Labour Movement for its members, taking into account that Orchid Country Club’s lease will be expiring on 31 December 2030. This is being studied and further updates will be provided in due course. The aim is to provide continued access to public golfing facilities for the general public and Labour Movement members.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;The lease for Tanah Merah Country Club’s Garden Course will expire on 31 December 2035. Given its proximity to Changi Airport, the land is being studied for uses that have synergies with the airport to support economic growth. More details will be announced closer to 2035.

{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp;The tenancy for Mandai Executive Golf Course will expire on 31 December 2026. As previously announced, the land occupied by the course will be used by the Ministry of Education (MOE) for the development of an Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre.

{:start="11"}
11.&nbsp;The following table summarises the future use of land for golf courses with leases expiring by 2035.

**Ensuring Public Access to the Sport and Developing Golf Talents**

{:start="12"}
12.&nbsp; In addition to a dedicated 18-hole public course, the Government will continue to ensure the provision of access to golf facilities for the public in the long term. To provide more training opportunities for our national team as well as promote golf among youth, the National Service Resort &amp; Country Club will set up a Centre of Excellence (COE) in partnership with the Singapore Golf Association (SGA). This would be in addition to the COE that is already set up in Keppel Club (Sime) to develop youth golfers in Singapore. This will provide dedicated weekly slots for the SGA to facilitate national and youth team training, to expose our athletes to different types of golf courses. This new COE will complement the existing weekly trainings conducted by SGA in other clubs. More details will be shared when ready.

{:start="13"}
13.&nbsp;Dr Su Chun Wei, Chief of the High Performance Sport Institute said, "Sport Singapore (SportSG) works closely with the Singapore Golf Association (SGA) to develop the sport of golf and support our elite golfers to excel on the international stage. Our collaboration with them focuses on identifying and developing promising junior golfers through initiatives like the SGA Future Squad, which provides a structured pathway into SGA's High Performance Programmes, as well as organising tournaments such as the SGA Junior Inter-Club League and SGA BFG Junior Golf Series that are hosted across various golf courses and clubs in Singapore throughout the year. SportSG also supports our promising and elite golfers through our spexPotential and spexScholarship programme, including Ryan Ang, Hiroshi Tai, Aloysa Atienza, James Leow and Shannon Tan."
