**Annex A - About Bahrain International Commercial Court and Singapore International Commercial Court**

The establishment of the <b>Bahrain International Commercial Court</b> (“<b>BICC</b>”) is a component of Bahrain’s ambition to build an international commercial dispute resolution hub with state-of-the-art infrastructure that can capitalise on the region’s strong economic growth. The BICC builds on the effective dispute resolution mechanisms already present in Bahrain, particularly, the Bahrain Chamber for Dispute Resolution and the latest amendments to adjudicate commercial disputes in English.

The <b>Singapore International Commercial Court</b> (“<b>SICC</b>”) has established a reputation as a leading and trusted neutral forum for efficient and effective international commercial dispute resolution.

The SICC bench comprises a diverse panel of eminent international and local Judges from civil law and common law traditions, experienced in adjudicating specialist commercial disputes. Described as “arbitration in litigation”, the SICC combines the best practices of international arbitration with the substantive principles of international commercial law, to offer procedures compatible with, and responsive to, the fast-changing needs and realities of international commerce.
