1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) announced today that it intends to designate DP Information Network Pte Ltd (DP Info), part of the Experian Group, as the operator of the Moneylenders Credit Bureau (MLCB) under Section 30D of the amended Moneylenders Act.

2. The designation of DP Info will facilitate the implementation of the comprehensive amendments to the Moneylenders Act earlier this year. These include the introduction of a new regulatory regime for the MLCB to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of borrower data; the introduction of an aggregate loan cap to provide better protection for borrowers; and various measures to raise industry standards. DP Info has been working closely with MinLaw to administer these changes.

3. The designation will be valid from the date of commencement of the amended Moneylenders Act to 1 March 2020, and will replace DP Info’s existing contract with MinLaw to operate the MLCB.
