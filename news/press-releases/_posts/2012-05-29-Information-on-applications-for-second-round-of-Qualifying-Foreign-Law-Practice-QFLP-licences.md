1. The *Committee to Develop the Singapore Legal Sector*, chaired by Justice V K Rajah <a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> (and comprising several senior practitioners from leading firms, including Wong Partnership, Drew & Napier and Rajah & Tann), made several recommendations to liberalise legal services in Singapore in order to make Singapore a vibrant legal hub . 

2. One of the main recommendations made by the Committee was that foreign law firms should be allowed to practise Singapore law. These and other proposals of the Committee were accepted by the Government. This allowed foreign law practices (FLPs) to obtain licences to practise permitted areas of Singapore law. <a href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>  Six FLPs were awarded QFLP licences in December 2008. <a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>

3. As part of the implementation of the recommendations of Justice Rajah’s Committee, further QFLP licences will be issued in the second half of this year. The invitation for applications will open from **1 July 2012 and close at 4pm (Singapore time) on 31 August 2012**. MinLaw will announce the award of the new licences by end 2012.

4. The applications will be assessed by an Evaluation Committee and a Selection Committee.  These Committees will include senior officials from the Ministries of Law, Finance, Trade and Industry and Education, as well senior officials from the Economic Development Board, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Attorney-General’s Chambers.

5. Similar to the first round of QFLP licences, the Committees will consider factors such as the applicant FLP’s commitment on the amount of offshore work that the Singapore office will do, and the number of lawyers who will be based in the Singapore office. The areas of legal practice that the Singapore office will offer, the extent to which the Singapore office will function as headquarters for the region, and the applicant FLP’s track record will also be considered. 

6. The QFLP licensees will have up to six months to set up their Singapore office, and their licences will be valid for an initial period of five years from then.

7. Prior to the opening of the application process, MinLaw will organise information sessions in June 2012 for FLPs interested in applying for a QFLP licence. FLPs should e-mail <MLAW_QFLP_Consultation@mlaw.gov.sg> to register interest for these sessions.
