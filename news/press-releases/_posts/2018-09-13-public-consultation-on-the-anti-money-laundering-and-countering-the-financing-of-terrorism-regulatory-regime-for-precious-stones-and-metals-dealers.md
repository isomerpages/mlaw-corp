1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) invites the public to provide feedback on the new anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulatory regime for precious stones and metals dealers (PSMD) in Singapore. The public consultation will run for one month, from **13 September 2018** to **12 October 2018**.    

2. Precious stones and metals are portable, valuable, and easily convertible to cash. This exposes the PSMD sector to inherent money laundering and terrorism financing risks.

3. Currently, PSMDs are not subject to AML/CFT supervision or requirements beyond the Cash Transaction Reporting regime<sup>[1]</sup> introduced in 2014. The new regime will close these gaps, mitigate ML/TF risks, and level up AML/CFT standards and increase trust in the sector. This will enhance the effectiveness of Singapore’s AML/CFT regime, combat crime and improve security, not only domestically but also globally.

**Proposed Regulatory Regime**

4. The proposed regime is outlined in the public consultation paper, with details on:

5. In developing the regulatory framework, MinLaw had conducted an industry survey and held informal discussions with industry stakeholders, including industry associations, manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers.
