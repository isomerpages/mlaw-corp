1. Follow-up investigations into Koh Seah Wee’s fraudulent activities at the Singapore Land Authority have revealed that Koh might also have carried out fraudulent activities at the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) where he was earlier posted as Assistant Director of the Information Technology Department from July 2004 to March 2007.

2. Koh is suspected to have conspired with a business entity to enable the latter to win IT contracts from IPOS.   The business entity would subsequently submit payment invoices for fictitious goods and services, and Koh would certify the invoices even though the goods and services were not delivered.  The transactions took place between December 2005 and March 2007. 

3. Investigations against Koh’s activities in IPOS are continuing.  The amount involved to date is about $286,000.

4. Immediately after the alleged fraud was uncovered, IPOS carried out an internal investigation. The Ministry of Law also established an independent review panel to investigate how the fraud had taken place, and to recommend improvements to IPOS’ systems and processes.  The panel was chaired by a senior Government official of another Ministry and comprised members from other Ministries.  

5. IPOS had in place finance and procurement processes which were in accordance with Government guidelines.  Following its internal investigation and the report of the independent review panel, IPOS took measures to further strengthen these internal controls, systems and processes.  These included strengthening internal audit structures and processes, centralising the procurement process, and ensuring that the purchasing officer and the receiving officer (who verifies the receipt of goods and services) are different individuals.    

6. Disciplinary investigations have commenced in respect of officers whose lapses in supervision might have allowed the fraud to take place undetected.  These investigations are in progress, and disciplinary action will be taken, if and where found appropriate.
