1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 16 October 2025, the Ministry of Law (“**MinLaw**”) launched a public consultation to seek feedback on the recommendations by the Committee to Review the Regulatory Framework for Law Practices and Collaborations in Singapore (the “**Committee**”).<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

{:start=“2”}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MinLaw is extending the public consultation period by 5 weeks, to 14 January 2026.&nbsp; MinLaw has been receiving a range of useful comments and feedback from the legal industry since the consultation began.
