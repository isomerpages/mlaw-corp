Human Rights Watch’s (HRW) statement on the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill is part of its long standing practice of issuing biased and one-sided statements about Singapore.

 

HRW was invited last year by the Select Committee of the Parliament of Singapore which was hearing evidence on this issue. It was an opportunity for HRW to give its views, and explain views it had previously expressed about free speech in Singapore, with local and international media present.

 

HRW did not dare to come before the Select Committee because it knew that its views were biased and indefensible, and without any basis in fact. HRW’s initial willingness to appear before the Select Committee evaporated once it was informed that its representative should be prepared to answer questions about its views on Singapore. HRW remained unwilling to appear, despite the offer of travel funding or video-conferencing as an alternative.

 

HRW’s unsubstantiated allegations were exposed during the Select Committee hearing. 

 

The Singapore Government will generally not respond further to HRW until HRW confirms that it is prepared to defend its views.
