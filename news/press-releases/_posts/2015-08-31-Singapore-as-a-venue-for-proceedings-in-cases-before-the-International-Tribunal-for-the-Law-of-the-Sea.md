***Joint Declaration Signed between Ministry of Law and President of the Tribunal***

1. Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Law, Mr Ng How Yue, and the President of the Tribunal, Judge Vladimir Golitsyn, today signed a Joint Declaration to mark a major move for Singapore to become a venue in Asia for proceedings in cases before a special chamber of the Tribunal or before the Tribunal to settle disputes relating to the law of the sea.


2. The Joint Declaration underscores the commitment of both sides to safeguarding the international rule of law in the region. In line with this commitment, the Singapore Government will provide appropriate facilities to the Tribunal whenever it is desirable for a special chamber of the Tribunal or the Tribunal to sit or exercise its functions in Singapore.


3. Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam said: “The Joint Declaration is a clear endorsement of Singapore as a neutral venue for the effective settlement of international disputes. It also demonstrates Singapore’s commitment to the international rule of law by facilitating access to ITLOS in order to serve the needs of the States of this region, with a view to promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes relating to the law of the sea.”


4. President Golitsyn said: “The Joint Declaration underscores the commitment of both sides to facilitate access to the Tribunal, by serving the needs of the States of this region and promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes relating to the law of the sea. In line with this commitment, both sides have agreed that whenever proceedings are instituted before a special chamber of the Tribunal or the Tribunal, States parties to the dispute may propose that the chamber or the Tribunal meet in the region, at a place convenient to them. I am extremely grateful to the Government of Singapore for its willingness to assist the Tribunal in the provision of appropriate facilities whenever the Tribunal considers it desirable for a special chamber of the Tribunal or the Tribunal to sit or exercise its functions in Singapore.”


5. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is an independent judicial body established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to hear any dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the UNCLOS. Singapore became a party to the Convention on 17 November 1994. Currently, there are 167 parties to the Convention, which comprises 166 States and the European Union.
