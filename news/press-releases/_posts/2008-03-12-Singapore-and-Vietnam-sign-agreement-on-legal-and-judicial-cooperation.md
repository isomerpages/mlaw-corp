1. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law Professor S Jayakumar and the Minister of Justice of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Mr Ha Hung Cuong signed a Memorandum of Understanding on legal and judicial cooperation on 12 March 2008.

2. The signing of this Memorandum of Understanding will strengthen and further develop effective legal and judicial cooperation between Singapore and Vietnam. Both countries will work towards enhancing greater understanding of each country's laws, legal systems and legal institutions.

3. Singapore and Vietnam intend to cooperate in a wide range of areas which include the drafting and administration of laws, development of legal and judicial expertise, development and promotion of domestic and international dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration and mediation and the administration and governance in the legal and judicial field. 

4. Cooperation between the two countries can take various forms, including the exchange of legal materials and publications, exchange of visits between relevant personnel (for example judges, academics, and legal practitioners) and the promotion of interaction through lectures, conferences, seminars and symposia. 

5. A Joint Committee (made up of senior officials from Singapore and Vietnam) will be established to monitor and review the cooperation regularly. This would allow both countries to discuss and put in place programmes beneficial to both countries.
