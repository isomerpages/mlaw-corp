1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) today launched a public consultation to gather public feedback on proposed changes to Singapore’s copyright regime. The public consultation will run for two months, ending on 24 October 2016.


2. Technological developments in the past decade have led to immense changes in how copyrighted works are created, distributed, accessed and used.  Copyright law must keep pace with modern developments so as to support creativity and innovation. This review seeks to ensure that our copyright regime continues to provide an environment that benefits both creators and users. 


**Summary of Key Changes to the Act**


<ol start="3">
<li>To provide creators with more recognition and practical protection, some of the key proposed recommendations for creators are:

  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
  <li>Creators will own the Copyright in certain specific works they are commissioned to create unless they agree otherwise.</li>
  <li> Creators will have a right of attribution – which will enable them to ask that they be credited as the creator, regardless of whether they still own the Copyright.</li>
  </ol>
  
 </li>       
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>In order for our Copyright regime to adapt to modern developments, some of the key proposed recommendations for users are:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Not-for-profit schools will be able to continue to develop and enhance their pedagogy using digital tools and the internet. For example, teachers and students will now be able to fully utilise online student portals to reproduce and share content to enhance learning.</li>

 

<li>Everyone can, subject to certain conditions, use “orphan works” even though the owner cannot be identified and contacted for consent.</li>

 
<li>Allowing text and data mining for the purposes of data analysis. This will support the growth of the data analytics business sector.</li>
