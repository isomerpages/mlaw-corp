1. Maxwell Chambers, the world’s first integrated dispute resolution complex, will soon also become the world’s first smart hearing facility, offering more convenient, secure and comfortable hearings for businesses, legal counsel, arbitrators and mediators, through the use of smart technology.

2. Turning Maxwell Chambers into a smart hearing facility is part of the Ministry of Law’s (MinLaw) larger plan to boost Singapore’s position as an international dispute resolution hub. This is a further investment to ensure that Singapore continues to have all the hallmarks of a great dispute resolution venue, with products and services regularly refreshed and upgraded to stay ahead of the competition.

3. This latest investment in service complements the ongoing investment in infrastructure. MinLaw is currently developing Maxwell Chambers Suites, which will add 120,000 square feet of office space and triple Maxwell Chambers’ current capacity. When completed in 2019, Maxwell Chambers Suites will provide 50 new offices over four floors for international dispute resolution institutions, arbitration chambers, law firms and ancillary services, and help meet growing regional demand for dispute resolution services.

**Improving Service, Raising Productivity**

4. MinLaw and Maxwell Chambers today launched the “Smart Maxwell” initiative, which includes smart booking, security, food and beverage, secretariat and concierge services, and a robot named “Max” to deliver files and food within the four-storey building. The initiative, supported by local enterprise development agency Enterprise Singapore, is also expected to generate more business opportunities for the legal industry in Singapore – which serves clients seeking dispute resolution at Maxwell Chambers. The use of smart technology will improve the ease of administration and logistics and allow disputing parties to better focus on their cases that are heard at Maxwell Chambers. The smart solutions will be co-developed with users and rolled out in Maxwell Chambers by the end of this year. It will be extended, in Phase 2, to the adjacent Maxwell Chambers Suites and serve the 50 new offices there when the new extension completes in 2019. The smart technology is developed jointly with two Singapore tech start-ups, Habitap and Techmetics.

5. Besides better service, the adoption of technology will help Maxwell Chambers boost productivity, meet growing demand, and result in significant time and cost savings. For example, currently, a user can spend up to half an hour collecting the physical access cards and distributing them to each business representative, legal counsel, arbitrator and/or mediator involved in the case, as and when they arrive, before each of them can make their way to the assigned room. In future, this will be instantaneous and automatic; each individual will be given secured access electronically and they can simply use their phones to gain access. The total cost savings from the smart solutions are estimated to be over half a million dollars a year.

6. Senior Minister of State for Law and Finance Ms Indranee Rajah S.C. launched the “Smart Maxwell” initiative in a ceremony attended by 50 lawyers, arbitrators and mediators who are tenants and users of Maxwell Chambers. Ms Rajah said, “Maxwell Chambers is today one of the world’s best dispute resolution facilities. However, we are not content to leave it at that. In order to not just stay ahead of the competition, but also be the global standard bearer, we must be prepared to take bold steps, push boundaries, leverage technology, and create a unique experience synonymous with the Maxwell brand that cannot be duplicated elsewhere, and which will make us the global venue of choice for dispute resolution.”

7. Ms Katherine Yap, Chief Executive of Maxwell Chambers, said, “Maxwell Chambers is today the world’s premier dispute resolution facility. But competition is keen. Many have come here, from around the world, to see what we have; it is not difficult to replicate these. What is harder to replicate is what we do and how we do it: a commitment to service, a spirit of innovation and continuously improving, and a symbiotic partnership with the Government, the profession, and the dispute resolution institutions and practitioners who grow their work using our facility.”
