1.&nbsp;The Criminal Procedure (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2024<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> (“<b>CPMAA 2024</b>”) was passed in Parliament on 5 February 2024 and is being operationalised in phases. The first and second phases of the amendments came into effect in May and August 2024 respectively.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>  The third phase, comprising the amendments relating to criminal disclosure and the unsoundness of mind (“<b>UOM</b>”) regime, will come into effect on 14 February 2025.

<b>Amendments relating to criminal disclosure</b>

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;In 2010, the Ministry of Law (“<b>MinLaw</b>”) introduced the Criminal Case Disclosure (“<b>CCD</b>”) regime, a statutory pre-trial disclosure framework under which the Prosecution and the Defence sequentially disclose and exchange information about their cases before trial. Since 2011, a common law disclosure regime has developed in parallel through case law.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;The CPMAA 2024 amendments were arrived at after extensive consultations with criminal justice stakeholders, including the Defence Bar, the Attorney-General’s Chambers (“<b>AGC</b>”) and the Courts. The amendments relate to two key aspects:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) First, the amendments <b>place the common law disclosure obligations on a statutory footing by codifying, clarifying or modifying aspects of these obligations</b>. This achieves greater clarity and certainty, as well as coherence through ensuring that these disclosure obligations align with the sequential nature of the CCD regime.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) Second, the amendments <b>fine-tune aspects of the CCD regime</b>. Among other things, the amendments expand the CCD regime by requiring compulsory participation in both State Court and High Court CCD cases. This facilitates greater pre-trial disclosure and allows for a clearer identification of the disputed issues, which in turn makes the trial more focused and efficient.</p>

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;To cater for ongoing criminal cases and specific situations, the Criminal Procedure (Saving and Transitional Provisions — Disclosure) Regulations 2025 (<a href="https://go.gov.sg/criminal-procedure-reg-2025">https://go.gov.sg/criminal-procedure-reg-2025</a>) have also been enacted and will also come into effect on 14 February 2025.

<b>Amendments to the UOM regime</b>

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;The Criminal Procedure Code also provides for special procedures to deal with two categories of accused persons:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) Those who are “unfit to plead” i.e. incapable of making their defence; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) Those who are acquitted on the basis that they were of unsound mind at the time that they committed the offences.</p>

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;The CPMAA 2024 amendments will further clarify and improve the regime, by:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a) Clarifying that only the General Division of the High Court (“<b>HC</b>”) can determine the maximum duration for which a person who is unfit to plead may be confined for a case that must or ought to be tried in the HC, and set out the applicable process for such cases;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b) Providing the Courts with the power to require or allow for videoconferencing in any UOM proceedings;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">c) Allowing the Courts to dispense with the attendance of subjects in UOM proceedings in the interests of justice; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">d) Clarifying the mechanisms for reporting of the Institute of Mental Health Visitors’ reviews, and for the issuance of confinement orders and conditional release orders by the Minister.</p>
