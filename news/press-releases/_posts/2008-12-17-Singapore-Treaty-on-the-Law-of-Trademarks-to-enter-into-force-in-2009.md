The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has announced the ratification of the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks by Australia on 16 December 2008. This is the 10th ratification of the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks and will allow the treaty to enter into force on 16 March 2009. 

This international treaty is the first treaty in Singapore's history to bear the country's name. It standardises procedural aspects of trademark registration and licensing and enables owners of trademarks and national trademark authorities to take advantage of efficiencies in using modern communications technologies to process and manage evolving trademark rights.
