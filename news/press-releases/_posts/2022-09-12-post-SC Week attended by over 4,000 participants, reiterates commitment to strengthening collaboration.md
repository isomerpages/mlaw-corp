Against this backdrop, he encouraged countries to come together to keep the global trading environment healthy.

5.         Speakers and panellists shared the following key insights: 

a.	         **Singapore's Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minister for Law, Mr Edwin Tong SC** shared Singapore’s journey to becoming a leading centre for international commercial dispute resolution in a fireside chat during the UNCITRAL Academy Conference. He expressed optimism about growing opportunities for young practitioners in Asia as new areas and opportunities emerge in this region. He added that Singapore will continue to look for ways to maintain the high standards of the legal industry, and ensure that it remains adaptable and responsive to the economic and technological changes ahead. 

b.	         On the topic of dispute resolution in a digital economy, panellists noted that with greater use of technology in dispute resolution proceedings, confidentiality and cybersecurity issues have emerged. They shared their views on the need to raise the technology competence and subject matter expertise of practitioners, for instance, in new technologies such as cryptocurrency, and explored innovations that could make dispute resolution more efficient. 

c.	         On Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) reforms, panellists discussed reforms to the ISDS system, with perspectives from the Asia-Pacific region. Among the options being developed in UNCITRAL Working Group III, mediation emerged as a key reform option, with panellists discussing how it could play an even greater role in the context of ISDS reforms. The new ICSID Mediation Rules 2022, established by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), were also discussed.<br>

At the ISDS capacity-building workshop supported by the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA) and ICSID, panellists explored recent developments in Investor-State mediation, and also took a deep dive into the practical considerations surrounding such meditation, through a multi-stakeholder perspective.

d.	         On mediation as a form of dispute resolution mechanism, the Industry capacity-building workshop, supported by the Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC), provided participants an opportunity to hear views on common user concerns, including time and potential costs incurred by mediation, and confidentiality and principles when drafting settlement agreements to avoid enforceability issues. New trends and innovative solutions were also discussed as speakers shared their experiences in resolving complex situations in financial, insolvency, high-tech, construction and shareholder disputes. Valuable insights and views on the latest progression of arbitration and mediation were exchanged, including how dispute resolution now takes on a customised approach in catering to the diverse needs and priorities of different industries and jurisdictions. 

e.	         The Government capacity-building workshop, supported by SIDRA, featured a panel of speakers who shared their experiences in their respective jurisdictions in signing and ratifying the SCM. Participants also exchanged views on topics such as mediator standards, rules of procedure in the enforcement of international mediated settlement agreements and relief under the SCM. 

f.	         Dispute settlement and climate change were also featured, with panellists providing their observations on how climate change has raised new and increased legal risks, resulting in a rise in disputes. The diverse panel noted how climate change disputes differ from others, and offered perspectives from Africa, Europe, India, Singapore and the United Kingdom. There was convergence in views that while the ecosystem of climate change is still nascent, there are opportunities for lawyers and mediators to capture work in this area by developing knowledge of domestic and international environmental rules. 

**Updates on the Singapore Convention on Mediation**

To date, there are 10 parties to the SCM – Singapore, Fiji, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Ecuador, Honduras, Turkey, Georgia and Kazakhstan, and 55 signatories.
