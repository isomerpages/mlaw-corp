4.                  **Ms Anna Joubin-Bret, Secretary of UNCITRAL**, said: “The world is evolving and change is what we need to embrace. As we navigate new possibilities, countries need to rally together in true commitment to establish harmonised dispute resolution frameworks. A strong reflection of this vision, the UNCITRAL Academy is a premier, global platform that we are proud to co-organise with MinLaw. Beyond increasing awareness of cross-border dispute resolution mechanisms, we hope to see greater implementation and use of the UNCITRAL Mediation Framework. We are confident that the UNCITRAL Academy and other activities during SC Week will help achieve this.”
