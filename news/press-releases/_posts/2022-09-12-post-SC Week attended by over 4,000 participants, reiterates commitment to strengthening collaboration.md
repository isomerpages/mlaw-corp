As we navigate new possibilities, countries need to rally together in true commitment to establish harmonised dispute resolution frameworks. A strong reflection of this vision, the UNCITRAL Academy is a premier, global platform that we are proud to co-organise with MinLaw. Beyond increasing awareness of cross-border dispute resolution mechanisms, we hope to see greater implementation and use of the UNCITRAL Mediation Framework.
