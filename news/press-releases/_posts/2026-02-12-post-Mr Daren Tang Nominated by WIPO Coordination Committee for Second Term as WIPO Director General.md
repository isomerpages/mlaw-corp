My heartfelt thanks also go to the&nbsp;Government of Singapore&nbsp;for their unwavering support, my colleagues for their passion and commitment to our work and my family for supporting me at every stage of this journey. As a Singaporean, I remain committed not just to the values of multilateralism but one that focuses on real impact and tangible results.
