3.	In accordance with the leaders’ agreement, to bring legal cooperation to a new and higher level, the two Ministers signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Exchanges and Cooperation between the Ministry of Law and the Chinese Ministry of Justice, establishing a Singapore-China Legal Cooperation Council that will convene biennially at the Vice-Minister level, alternating between Singapore and China. This will be complemented by annual working level meetings between the two Ministries to carry out legal cooperation activities under the auspices of the Council. Areas of cooperation covered by the MOU include strengthening the rule of law, international commercial dispute resolution, and the administration of the legal profession.
