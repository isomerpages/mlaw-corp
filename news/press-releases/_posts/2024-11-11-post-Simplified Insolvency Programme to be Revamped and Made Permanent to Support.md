{:start="1"} 1.&nbsp;The Ministry of Law (“<b>MinLaw</b>”) introduced the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution (Amendment) Bill (“<b>Bill</b>”) in Parliament today, to revamp the Simplified Insolvency Programme (“<b>SIP</b>”) and make it a permanent feature of the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (“<b>IRDA</b>”). This is part of MinLaw’s efforts to bolster Singapore’s insolvency framework and support for financially distressed companies.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

<b>Background</b>

{:start="2"} 2.&nbsp;The SIP was introduced in 2021 as a temporary measure to support eligible micro and small companies (“<b>MSCs</b>”) facing financial difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic, by helping them restructure their debts to rehabilitate their business or wind up via a simpler, faster and lower cost insolvency process. As at 25 October 2024, a total of 116 applications for the existing SIP were submitted, and 77 of these were accepted. Of these, 60 MSCs in severe financial distress were successfully assisted. The existing SIP is set to cease on 28 January 2026.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

{:start="3"} 3.&nbsp;In its place, the revamped, permanent programme will facilitate better access to insolvency processes by providing a simpler and more cost-effective process, which will benefit more companies going forward.

<b>Key Amendments</b>

{:start="4"} 4.&nbsp;The Bill will modify two processes under the SIP, namely the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“<b>SDRP</b>”) and the Simplified Winding Up Programme (“<b>SWUP</b>”).<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>

{:start="5"} 5.&nbsp;The key changes to the two processes will be administered by licensed Insolvency Practitioners (“<b>IPs</b>”) in the private sector who are experienced and have the relevant expertise. They are as follows:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a)&nbsp;<u>Simpler eligibility criteria</u>: The new SDRP and SWUP will have only one general eligibility criterion i.e. the company’s total liabilities must not exceed $2 million. This will allow companies that are not MSCs to also benefit from the SIP.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">b)&nbsp;<u>Simpler application process</u>: Only key supporting documents will be required when a company applies for the SDRP. The IPs, when assessing whether the company meets the requirements for entry into the SDRP, may request more documents. For the SWUP, if the company has incomplete records, the company may submit a Directors’ declaration that the eligibility criterion is met. To prevent abuse, enforcement provisions will target false declarations.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">c)&nbsp;<u>More effective administration</u>: In the new SDRP, only one class of creditors will vote on the debt repayment plan, instead of up to three in the current SDRP. Court involvement will also be limited to situations where approval of a debt repayment plan is disputed and only on specified grounds. The SDRP may transit to other liquidation processes so that unviable companies can be liquidated and dissolved efficiently.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Costs of the new SWUP are reduced by removing the need to publish notifications in the Government e-Gazette and Newspapers, and requiring publication on MinLaw’s website only. Lodgments will still be on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority’s Bizfile for permanent record. In situations where no creditor funding is given to the IP to conduct investigations to recover assets, the IP will not be required to take any further investigative action, and may proceed to complete the liquidation and thereafter dissolve the company.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">d)&nbsp;<u>Strengthened creditor protection</u>: In the new SDRP, the initial moratorium period during which creditors are unable to enforce their rights is shortened from 90 to 30 days, and a black-out period of five years also applies (i.e. a company which fails to successfully complete the SDRP cannot apply for the SDRP again until at least 5 years have elapsed).<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

{:start="6"} 6.&nbsp;The detailed list of the differences between the features of the existing and current SIP can be found in the <a href="#Annex"><b><u>Annex</u></b></a>.

{:start="7"} 7.&nbsp;MinLaw will continue to review processes and work closely with industry stakeholders to strengthen Singapore’s restructuring and insolvency framework and ecosystem.
