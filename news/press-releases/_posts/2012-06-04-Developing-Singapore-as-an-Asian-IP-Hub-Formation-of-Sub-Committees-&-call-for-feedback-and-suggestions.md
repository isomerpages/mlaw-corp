1. Intellectual Property (IP) has become an increasingly important component of the global economy. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) aims to expand Singapore’s role as an Asian IP hub, and service the potential growth in demand for IP services in the region.

2. To this end, we earlier announced the [setting up of an IP Steering Committee](/news/press-releases/intellectual-property-steering-committee-to-develop-singapore-into-an-asian-ip-hub) to formulate the IP Hub Master Plan to guide Singapore’s development as an IP hub.   The Steering Committee is chaired by Mr Teo Ming Kian, Chairman of MediaCorp Pte Ltd. Mr Teo was previously Chairman of the Economic Development Board, Chairman of the then National Science and Technology Board, and Permanent Secretary (National Research and Development), among other appointments.

<ol start="3">
<li>The Steering Committee will be supported by two sub-committees which have now been formed to focus on the areas of (i) developing a vibrant marketplace for IP transaction and commercialisation, and (ii) building world-class IP capabilities and infrastructure.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

<li>Sub-Committee 1 is co-chaired by Mr Magnus Bocker, Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Exchange; and Mr Viktor Cheng, Deputy Chief Executive (Infrastructure and Capability Development Group / Corporate Services Group), Intellectual Property Office of Singapore.</li>

<li>Sub-Committee 2 is co-chaired by Dr Stanley Lai, SC, Head of Intellectual Property Practice, Allen & Gledhill LLP; and Ms Danielle Yeow, Deputy Chief Executive (Registries Group / Legal Policy & International Affairs Department), Intellectual Property Office of Singapore.</li>
