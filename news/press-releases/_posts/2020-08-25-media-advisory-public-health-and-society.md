1.	At the opening of the 14th Parliament on 24 August 2020, President Halimah Yacob spoke about the need to provide greater social support and strengthen our safety nets for the long-term, in response to a more disruptive and uncertain environment exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

2.	In her Address, President Halimah emphasised that the Government will do more to support every Singaporean at each stage of life, to build a stronger and more cohesive society. This includes improving children’s lives through quality education, ensuring middle-aged Singaporeans have the help they need to secure good jobs, looking after seniors so they can age well, and caring for the most vulnerable members of our society. Importantly, those at a disadvantage must be given opportunities to level up, keeping our society open and strengthening our social mobility. Together, we can build a fair and just society with the support and participation of all Singaporeans.

3.	**The Ministries under this theme have outlined the following key thrusts:**

	(a)	Sustain our public health fight against COVID-19 to keep the public safe.

	(b)	Sustain support for Singaporeans whose lives and livelihoods have been affected by COVID-19, to help them overcome and emerge stronger from the crisis.

	(c)	Provide opportunities for every Singaporean to achieve their full potential, and improve social mobility in our society.

	(d)	Build a caring, inclusive and resilient society that leaves no Singaporean behind, while forging deeper partnerships as part of the Singapore Together movement to better support vulnerable and disadvantaged Singaporeans.
