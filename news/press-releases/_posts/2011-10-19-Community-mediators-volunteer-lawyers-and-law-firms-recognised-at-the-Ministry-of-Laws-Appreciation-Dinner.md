1. Over 70 volunteers received awards from the Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, at the Ministry of Law’s (MinLaw) Appreciation Dinner this evening (19 October 2011).

2. The event recognised Community Mediators who volunteer with the Ministry’s Community Mediation Unit (CMU), Assigned Solicitors who work with the Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) to provide pro bono legal aid, as well as legal practitioners who have made significant contributions of expertise to the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO).

3. This year, in addition to the Minister for Law Outstanding Volunteer Award and the Minister for Law Appreciation Award, the Ministry introduced several new categories of awards, such as the CMU Appreciation Award, LAB Amicus Award, LAB Appreciation Award, as well as the LAB Distinguished Service Award. Five law firms were also recognised for encouraging their lawyers to volunteer and take on a significant number of cases with LAB. These new awards have been introduced to better recognise and appreciate the contributions and efforts of the volunteers.

4. MinLaw and its departments are indebted to these volunteers. The Community Mediators have worked tirelessly to help parties resolve community and social disputes. Volunteer Assigned Solicitors have been a key pillar of LAB’s Legal Aid Scheme since its inception in 1958, and ensure that needy members of the society have access to justice. Over the years, the insolvency practitioners have assisted IPTO by providing expertise and advice to shape insolvency practices in Singapore.
