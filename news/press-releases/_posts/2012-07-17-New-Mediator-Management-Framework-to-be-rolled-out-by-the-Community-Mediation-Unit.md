*The Community Mediation Unit also welcomed 18 new volunteer mediators and reappointed 130 mediators*

1. The Community Mediation Unit (CMU), a department under the Ministry of Law, held its annual Mediators’ Appointment Ceremony and Appreciation Dinner on 17 July 2012 (Tuesday) at Grand Park City Hall. Senior Parliamentary Secretary (SPS) for Education and Law, Ms Sim Ann, was the Guest-of-Honour at the event.

2. The event was an occasion for the CMU to recognise the contributions of its panel of over 100 community mediators, who tirelessly volunteered their time and effort to facilitate the resolution of social and community disputes at the Community Mediation Centres. In 2011, these volunteers mediated close to 600 cases, with about 70 per cent of the cases resolved successfully.  

**Mediator Management Framework**

3. Ms Sim Ann announced the CMU’s new initiative to raise the professionalism of its panel of community mediators under a new Mediator Management Framework (MMF) at the event. Targeted for implementation from August 2012 onwards, the MMF will institute and formalise criteria for the appointment, re-appointment and training of its mediators. Community mediators can look forward to more training opportunities for professional development and growth. Specific criteria and targets will also be introduced for a more meaningful advancement through the mediator tiers.

4. The more experienced mediators will get the opportunity to mentor the junior mediators in the panel. A new pinnacle appointment – the Principal Master Mediator (PMM) – will also be introduced. The PMM will work with the CMU to develop a mentorship programme for junior mediators, identify suitable training programmes for the panel of mediators, and ensure that the mediators uphold the conduct and standards expected. More details on the initiatives under the MMF will be announced in due course.

**Reappointment of Community Mediators and Appointment of New Volunteers**

5. The CMU re-appointed 130 volunteers as community mediators for a new three-year term from 1 August 2012. Also joining the panel are 18 new volunteers, whose ages range from 31 to 66 years of age. These new volunteers are professionals with full-time careers who will contribute their time during weekdays, week nights and Saturday mornings to mediate disputes between neighbours, family members, friends and others.

**Strengthening Referral Partnerships**

6. Ms Sim also acknowledged the role and contributions of other government agencies such as the Subordinate Courts, the Housing Development Board and People’s Association in working together with the CMU over the years. They have been the bridge by which the community has access to mediation.


**Conclusion**

7. As Singapore’s social landscape evolves, it is vital for us to ensure that disputes within the community are effectively and amicably resolved through mediation. The community mediators have a pivotal role to play in keeping the social fabric of Singapore strong, and maintaining social harmony within the community.
