1. Singapore today became the first member of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) to deposit its instrument of ratification for the Singapore Treaty on the Law of Trademarks. 

2. The Treaty was adopted at the WIPO Diplomatic Conference held in Singapore in March 2006. It was named the "Singapore Treaty" in recognition of Singapore hosting and chairing the final round of negotiations at the Conference. The Treaty updates the 1994 WIPO Trademark Law Treaty by further harmonising trademark application procedures and providing for electronic filing of trademark applications. These revisions will result in cheaper and more efficient trademark registration procedures globally.

3. The ratification underscores Singapore's strong support for the objectives of the Treaty. To-date, more than 50 states have signed the Treaty, signalling their intention to ratify and be bound by the Treaty. The Treaty will enter into force three months after ten WIPO members have deposited their instruments of ratification or accession.

4. Further information on the Treaty is available on the website of the WIPO at [http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/singapore/](http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/singapore/)
