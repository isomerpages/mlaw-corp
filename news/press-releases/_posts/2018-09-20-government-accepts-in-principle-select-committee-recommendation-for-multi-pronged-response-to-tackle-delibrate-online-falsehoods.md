1. On 19 September 2018, the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods – Causes, Consequences and Countermeasures submitted its report to Parliament on the Committee’s findings and recommendations.

2. The Government commends the Committee on its comprehensive and thoughtful report. The Government acknowledges the findings of the Committee on the serious challenges and real risks posed by deliberate online falsehoods to the international community, including how online falsehoods can harm national security and undermine a nation’s sovereignty. They could affect a country’s social cohesion, incite public unrest and violence, and cause undue public alarm. The Committee has made clear that Singapore is not immune to this grave threat.

3. The Government accepts in-principle the Select Committee’s recommendation for a multi-pronged response to tackle the challenges and risks posed by deliberate online falsehoods. The Government will study the Committee’s report closely and work with stakeholders to roll out the non-legislative and legislative measures recommended by the Committee over the next few months. These measures will be geared towards (i) nurturing an informed public, (ii) reinforcing social cohesion and trust, (iii) promoting fact-checking, (iv) disrupting online falsehoods, and (v) dealing with threats to national security and sovereignty.
