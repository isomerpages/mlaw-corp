In response to media queries, the Ministry of Law has issued the following statement:

1. Essex Court Chambers Duxton (Singapore Group Practice) is an association of Singapore-qualified lawyers. The applicant lawyers had expressly confirmed to the Ministry of Law that Essex Court Chambers Duxton (Singapore Group Practice) was separate and distinct from, and independent of, the English barristers’ chambers, Essex Court Chambers in London. This confirmation was given in their application submitted to the Ministry.

2. The Ministry of Law is therefore both surprised and concerned by various media reports which suggest that Essex Court Chambers Duxton (Singapore Group Practice) has been “set up”, “opened” or “launched” by Essex Court Chambers, and that the Singapore group practice is an “annexe”, “new practice group” or the “local brand” of the English chambers. The Ministry has not approved any of this. 

3. Contrary to some suggestions which have been made, the position is also that barristers from Essex Court Chambers in England cannot practise Singapore law and cannot appear in Singapore’s courts unless they have been given leave by the Singapore courts to do so or have been admitted to the Singapore Bar. 

4. The Ministry has asked Essex Court Chambers Duxton (Singapore Group Practice) to clarify the position and avoid any misimpression. A copy of the Ministry’s letter to the Singapore group practice is enclosed.
