At present, holders of Second Class Lower Division Honours or equivalent law degrees from Scheduled Universities who were full-time internal candidates must fulfil a three year legal work requirement in order to qualify to practise law in Singapore. The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Committee to Develop the Singapore Legal Sector to reduce the requirement to two years.

Candidates must do so by filling in the prescribed Form I that can be downloaded from the Board's webpage at [http://www.sile.org.sg](http://www.sile.org.sg/). Please note that the 2-year work requirement must be fulfilled at the date of the application for an exemption.
