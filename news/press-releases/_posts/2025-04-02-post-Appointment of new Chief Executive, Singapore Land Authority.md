<p>1. Mr Calvin Phua will be appointed as the Chief Executive of the
Singapore Land Authority (SLA) from 1 May 2025. He will succeed Mr Colin
Low, who has been SLA’s Chief Executive since 2021.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Outgoing Chief Executive, Mr Colin Low</u></strong>
</p>
<p>2. Mr Colin Low was appointed as Chief Executive of SLA on 12 April 2021.
Under Mr Low’s leadership, SLA has made significant strides in optimising
and rejuvenating State land and properties for diverse economic, social,
and community uses. Understanding the importance of sustainability and
the role State properties can play in serving the community, Mr Low had
a pivotal role in initiating sustainable asset management practices and
he drove the adoption of green practices and meaningful community programming
as part of the SLA-managed price-quality tender system.
<br>
</p>
<p>3. In the geospatial realm, Mr Low launched the refreshed Singapore Geospatial
Master Plan Version 2.0, which spearheaded geospatial adoption across multiple
sectors, including the social and healthcare sectors via barrier-free access
routing and social prescribing. During Mr Low’s term, SLA formed local
and regional partnerships that leverage geospatial data. This resulted
in advancements in smart nation solutions, including the development of
3D city models and new mapping datasets that support climate change initiatives.
Mr Low also put SLA on the global map, through involvement at key international
geospatial events and forging cross-border partnerships with countries
such as Bhutan and Saudi Arabia.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Incoming Chief Executive, Mr Calvin Phua</u></strong>
</p>
<p>4. Mr Calvin Phua is currently the Deputy Secretary (Policy) of the Ministry
of Law (MinLaw). Prior to MinLaw, he served in various ministries and was
the Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Transport.
<br>
</p>
<p>5. During his time at MinLaw, Mr Phua led efforts to strengthen Singapore’s
legal system and improve access to justice, including the establishment
of the Public Defender’s Office. He also worked with various institutions
to build capacity and enhance Singapore’s offerings as an international
dispute resolution hub. To alleviate the economic impact of COVID-19, Mr
Phua led the implementation of enabling legal frameworks that provided
relief to affected businesses and individuals.
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>In Appreciation</u></strong>
</p>
<p>6. Mr Luke Goh, Permanent Secretary of MinLaw said, “We are deeply appreciative
of Colin’s contributions to SLA. Colin has brought invaluable experience
and unique perspective from the private sector into public service, and
facilitated stronger collaboration between SLA and the private and people
sectors. Under his leadership, SLA has innovated and enabled new and creative
adaptive reuse of State land, in keeping with SLA’s vision of ‘Limited
Land. Unlimited Space’. Colin also led the team to push frontiers in the
geospatial domain, positioning Singapore as a thought leader internationally
in geospatial capabilities. Our heartfelt thanks to Colin for his contributions.
We look forward to continue working closely with Calvin in his new capacity
as the Chief Executive of SLA, and have every confidence that he will build
on Colin’s efforts and bring SLA to greater heights.”
<br>
</p>
<p>7. Mr Yeoh Oon Jin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of SLA, said, “On
behalf of the Board of Directors of SLA, we would like to extend our heartfelt
gratitude to Colin for his inspiring leadership, exceptional dedication
and steadfast service over the years. His guidance has been instrumental
in shaping the success of SLA’s forward-thinking and diverse initiatives
across State properties, geospatial and regulatory domains, and we wish
him all the best in his future endeavours. As we bid farewell to Colin,
we warmly welcome Calvin as SLA’s incoming Chief Executive, whose strategic
insights and proven expertise will provide seamless continuity in vision
and execution that will lead SLA’s next chapter of growth and contributions
to the nation.”</p>
