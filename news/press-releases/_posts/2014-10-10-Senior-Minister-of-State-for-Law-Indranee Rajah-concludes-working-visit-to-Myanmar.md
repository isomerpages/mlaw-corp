1. Senior Minister of State (SMS) for Law and Education, Ms Indranee Rajah SC, was in Myanmar for a working visit from 8 to 11 October 2014 to strengthen the legal cooperation ties between Singapore and Myanmar.


2. During the visit, SMS Indranee met with Chief Justice of the Union, U Htun Htun Oo, Union Attorney General, Dr Tun Shin, and senior members of the Myanmar legal fraternity.


3. On 9 October, SMS Indranee signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the Singapore-Myanmar Integrated Legal Exchange between the Ministry of Law and the Supreme Court of the Union. On 10 October, SMS Indranee witnessed the signing of a similar Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Law and the Union Attorney General’s Office. Both MOUs seek to enhance greater understanding of the laws, legal systems, and legal and judicial institutions of Singapore and Myanmar. These objectives will be achieved through the exchange of legal materials, study visits, collaborative seminars and symposiums, attachments and scholarships for Myanmar officials. The Ministry of Law, the Supreme Court of the Union and the Union Attorney General’s Office will also develop collaborative education, training, and knowledge transfer to enhance the mutual cooperation between both Parties. 


4. During the visit, SMS Indranee also attended the opening of a Commercial Law Workshop jointly organised by the Ministry of Law, Myanmar’s Union Attorney General’s Office, and the Law Society of Singapore. This Commercial Law Workshop is the first jointly organised event by the three institutions. The President of the Law Society, Mr Lok Vi Ming, S.C. and other lawyers from the Singapore Bar shared their knowledge on a variety of Commercial Law topics.


5. SMS Indranee was joined by senior officials from the Ministry of Law, the Supreme Court, and members of The Law Society of Singapore. 


6. Legal cooperation between Singapore and Myanmar has been steadily growing. Earlier in February this year, the law faculties of the National University of Singapore and the Singapore Management University signed MOUs with their counterparts at the University of Yangon and the University of Mandalay respectively to enhance cooperation in legal education.
