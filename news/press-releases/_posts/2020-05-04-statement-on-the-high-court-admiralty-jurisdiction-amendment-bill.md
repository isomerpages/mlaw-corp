1.  The Singapore Ministry of Law will table the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) (Amendment) Bill ("the Bill") for First Reading in Parliament on 4 May 2020.

2.  The High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act is the primary legislation on admiralty jurisdiction in Singapore. The Bill will extend the Singapore High Court's admiralty jurisdiction to special compensation claims arising from salvage operations which prevent or minimise environmental damage, even if the ship or its cargo are not saved. Salvors may hence enforce such special compensation claims by way of actions <i>in rem</i> (i.e. against a ship).

3.  The Bill complements Singapore's upcoming accession to the International Convention on Salvage, as well as earlier amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act. By placing special compensation claims on the same footing as traditional salvage claims, the Bill will incentivise salvors to protect the environment during salvage operations.
