{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Law introduced the Land Surveyors (Amendment) Bill 2024 (“Bill”) for First Reading in Parliament today.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill, when passed, will facilitate the implementation of the ASEAN Framework Arrangement for the Mutual Recognition of Surveying Qualifications (“ASEAN MRA”) in Singapore. Signed by ASEAN Member States in 2007, the ASEAN MRA aims to facilitate mobility of surveying professionals in ASEAN and promote the adoption of best practices on standards and qualifications in the field.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the implementation of the ASEAN MRA, the ASEAN Registered Surveyor (“ARS”) Scheme will be introduced in Singapore. The ARS Scheme will enhance collaboration amongst land surveyors across the region. By joining the ARS Scheme:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
a. &nbsp; Eligible Singapore-registered land surveyors will be able to practice in other ASEAN jurisdictions in accordance with the parameters set by the ASEAN Competent Authority Committee on Surveying (“ACAS”), providing them greater recognition and opening up opportunities for them overseas.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
b. &nbsp; Eligible overseas-based land surveyors registered under the ARS Scheme and with Singapore’s Land Surveyors Board (“LSB”) will be allowed to collaborate with a local registered surveyor on surveying projects in Singapore, and to include their names and credentials on non-cadastral survey plans/documents, alongside those of the local registered surveyor whom they are collaborating with. This will encourage the mutual exchange of knowledge, expertise and best practices between local and foreign surveyors, especially in niche surveying work and equipment</p>

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, the implementation details of the ARS Scheme are still being discussed. More details will be shared by LSB before implementation.

**Proposed Amendments in the Bill**

{:start=“5”}
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Bill will facilitate the implementation of the ASEAN MRA as well as future Mutual Recognition Arrangements (“MRA”) on land surveyors that Singapore might enter into. The Bill also introduces key changes related to land surveying in Singapore. The key proposed amendments in the Bill are:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
a. &nbsp; <u>Administration of the register of foreign land surveyors</u>: The Bill introduces amendments that will require the LSB to maintain an annual register for foreign surveyors. It also sets out the process for registration, including the eligibility criteria for registration, the requirement of a registration fee, and circumstances that may result in the cancellation of the registration.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
b. &nbsp; <u>Scope of work of foreign land surveyors</u>: The Bill will allow registered foreign surveyors to carry out certain types and manner of survey work in Singapore as permitted by the LSB pursuant to an MRA.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
c. &nbsp; <u>Introduction of title “RS” for local registered surveyors</u>: The Bill will allow local registered surveyors to use the title “RS”, which will give them greater professional recognition. It will also empower the LSB to allow registered foreign surveyors to use a designation approved by LSB.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
d. &nbsp; <u>Applications by local registered surveyors to carry out survey work outside of Singapore</u>: The Bill provides that local registered surveyors who wish to carry out survey work outside of Singapore in accordance with an MRA may apply to the LSB to be recognised for the purposes of that MRA.

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
e. &nbsp; <u>Revisions to fines and penalties</u>: The Bill also proposes increases in fines and penalties to ensure that the fines and penalties continue to serve as effective deterrents against illegal practice and improper conduct in land surveying.</p>
