1. A post published on the National Times Singapore (NTS) Facebook page on 15 May 2020 made several false and misleading statements about the scope and application of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). A Correction Direction has been issued to the NTS Facebook page and a Targeted Correction Direction issued to Facebook in respect of these false statements on 27 May 2020.

2. The Correction Direction requires NTS to publish a correction notice, while the Targeted Correction Direction requires Facebook to communicate the correction notice by means of its service to all end-users in Singapore who access the false statements through its service. The correction notice provides a link to the facts and the Government’s clarifications on the matter (<a href="http://www.gov.sg/article/factually270520">http://www.gov.sg/article/factually270520</a>).

3. The NTS Facebook page is run by Mr Alex Tan, who has repeatedly and deliberately conveyed falsehoods affecting the public interest. This is the seventh occasion in which Correction Directions under POFMA have been issued against a Facebook page operated by him.
