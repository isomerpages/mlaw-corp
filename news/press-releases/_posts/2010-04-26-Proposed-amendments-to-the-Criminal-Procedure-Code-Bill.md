The proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) Bill were tabled in Parliament on 26 April 2010.

The CPC provides the regulatory framework for criminal investigations, trials and appeals, and other ancillary matters. After the close of the Public Consultation on the draft CPC (Amendment) Bill in February 2009, the Ministry of Law organised a series of Working Group meetings with representatives from relevant government agencies, the Law Society, the Association of Criminal Lawyers Singapore, the National University of Singapore, the Singapore Management University as well as some legal practitioners.

The proposed key amendments in the CPC Bill are set out in the accompanying attachments.
