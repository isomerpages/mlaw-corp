1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) today launched a public consultation to gather public feedback on Singapore’s current copyright collective rights management ecosystem. Suggestions are being sought on how the ecosystem can be enhanced to better meet the needs of creators and users of copyright works in the digital age. 

2. The public consultation will run for one month, ending on 16 June 2017. It is part of a broader overall review of Singapore’s copyright regime, which was the subject of an earlier public consultation in August to November 2016. 

**Background**

{:start="3"}
3. Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) manage copyright works for creators. They license out the works to numerous users, collect licence fees for their use, and distribute the monies back to individual creators in the form of royalties.

4. Therefore, CMOs play a key role by facilitating the efficient and mass use of copyrighted works.  Without CMOs, it will be impractical for individual creators and users to negotiate and license the use of the copyrighted works. It is therefore important that the collective rights management ecosystem functions well.

5. A fuller explanation of CMOs and information on various CMOs in Singapore is found at the IPOS’ website,
