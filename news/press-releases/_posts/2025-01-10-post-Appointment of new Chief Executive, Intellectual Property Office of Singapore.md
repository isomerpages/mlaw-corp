2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs Rena Lee (陈惠菁), was appointed as Chief Executive of IPOS on 1 August 2020. During her term, she led her team to elevate Singapore’s position as a global intellectual property (IP) and intangible assets (IA) hub. Rena and her team drove the implementation of the Singapore IP Strategy (SIPS) 2030 to support enterprises and the wider innovation community, and strengthen Singapore’s attractiveness for IP and IA activities. She pushed significant legislative and policy reforms to the IP regime and continued efforts in international engagement with IP offices all over the world on issues relevant to the global IP ecosystem, including emerging issues relating to frontier technology like Artificial Intelligence. She also led Singapore’s delegations in treaty negotiations, contributing to the adoption of two new World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties. Under her leadership, Singapore maintained its position as the most innovative country in the South-East Asia, East Asia and Oceania region in the Global Innovation Index, and achieved its highest global ranking in a decade, ranking fourth globally.
