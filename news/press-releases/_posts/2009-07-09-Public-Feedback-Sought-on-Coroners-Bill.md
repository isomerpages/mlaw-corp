1. The Ministry of Law is proposing to enact a Coroners Bill on death reporting, investigation and Coroner's Inquiries. The proposal for a dedicated Bill on coronial matters arose out of the review of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), where the provisions on Coroner's Inquiries are currently found. 

<ol start="2">
<li>Broadly, the proposed Bill makes three key changes to the current system:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

<li>The Coroners Inquiry will become a fact-finding inquiry. Currently, the Coroners Inquiry is a quasi-criminal one, where the Coroner is required not only to inquire into the facts and circumstances behind a death but to also identify if any person is criminally responsible for the death.</li>
<li>It will facilitate more effective investigation into deaths where medical treatment or care is the suspected cause.</li>
<li>The draft Bill will define the Coroner's jurisdiction and extend it in certain specific cases.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

3. The aim of these proposals is to update our coronial system and more clearly define its role so that it can better serve the public interest.
