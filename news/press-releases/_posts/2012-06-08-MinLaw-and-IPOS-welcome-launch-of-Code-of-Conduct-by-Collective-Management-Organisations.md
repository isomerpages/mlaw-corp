1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) welcome today’s launch of the industry Code of Conduct by Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) <a href="#fn"><sup>1</sup></a> in the music industry. 

2. MinLaw and IPOS are glad that the CMOs have come together to develop a self-regulatory framework for the licensing schemes they administer. The framework is an important step towards enhancing transparency, corporate governance and accountability by the CMOs towards their licensees for the usage of music works in Singapore. The industry Code of Conduct complements the Government’s efforts to develop a robust IP regime by strengthening confidence among copyright owners and their licensees in the fair, efficient and effective administration of copyright in Singapore.
