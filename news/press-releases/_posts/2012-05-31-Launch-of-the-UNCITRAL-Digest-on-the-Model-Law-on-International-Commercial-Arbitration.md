4. As part of MinLaw’s continuing efforts to keep our arbitration regime at the forefront of best practices and developments in international arbitration, MinLaw introduced the International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Foreign Limitation Periods Bill 2012 in Parliament earlier in March 2012. Both Bills were passed on 9 April 2012, and will come into force on **<u>1 June 2012</u>**, along with consequential amendments to the Rules of Court. This review of the IAA, together with our other efforts, will further entrench Singapore as a pre-eminent arbitration hub.
