The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and Maxwell Chambers, in collaboration with the Secretariat of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), will launch the first published UNCITRAL Digest on the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration at Maxwell Chambers on 9 June 2012.


2. Singapore is privileged and honoured to be the first country to hold a launch event for this Digest. The launch of the Digest leads the run-up to the International Council for Commercial Arbitration (ICCA) Conference 2012, which will take place from 10 to 13 June 2012.

3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law, Mr K Shanmugam, will officiate the launch of the Digest.

4. As part of MinLaw’s continuing efforts to keep our arbitration regime at the forefront of best practices and developments in international arbitration, MinLaw introduced the International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2012 and the Foreign Limitation Periods Bill 2012 in Parliament earlier in March 2012. Both Bills were passed on 9 April 2012, and will come into force on **<u>1 June 2012</u>**, along with consequential amendments to the Rules of Court. This review of the IAA, together with our other efforts, will further entrench Singapore as a pre-eminent arbitration hub.
