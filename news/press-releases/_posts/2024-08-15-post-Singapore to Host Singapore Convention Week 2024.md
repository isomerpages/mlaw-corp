1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Singapore Convention Week (SC Week) 2024 will return from 26 - 30 August this year. This follows a successful SC Week 2023, which saw more than 4,500 participants from around the world discussing matters on global dispute resolution.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SC Week 2024 continues to be a platform that brings together thought leaders, experts, practitioners and policy makers from the legal, business, and government sectors to discuss emerging trends, address common issues, deliberate on new innovations and exchange insights in the areas of dispute resolution. This is increasingly important as the world undergoes rapid transformation brought about by technological advancements, economic shifts, and geopolitical changes.

Centered around the theme of ‘Separating Disruptions from Distractions in an Evolving World’, SC Week 2024 will focus on providing insights into harnessing emerging technologies and exercising strategic foresight to thrive amidst continuous change. SC Week this year will feature an extensive line-up of events on dispute resolution, including panel discussions, workshops, debates, lectures, social and networking events:
