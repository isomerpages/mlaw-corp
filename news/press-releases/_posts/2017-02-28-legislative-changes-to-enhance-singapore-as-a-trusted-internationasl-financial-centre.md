1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) has submitted the Trustees (Amendment) Bill 2017 for First Reading in Parliament today. The proposed amendments underline Singapore’s commitment as a responsible member of the international community to international standards and global efforts in countering money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion.
