1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) has submitted the Trustees (Amendment) Bill 2017 for First Reading in Parliament today. The proposed amendments underline Singapore’s commitment as a responsible member of the international community to international standards and global efforts in countering money laundering, terrorism financing and tax evasion.

2. Over the years, Singapore has invested substantial efforts to enhance its anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing regime to uphold its reputation as a clean and trusted international financial centre. The Trustees (Amendment) Bill is part of Singapore’s whole-of-government ongoing review to ensure that corporate vehicles and trusts are not misused for improper purposes.

3. The proposed amendments to the Trustees Act seek to require trustees to maintain beneficial ownership information and proper accounting records of express trusts. This will enhance the transparency of ownership and control structures of express trusts, and prescribe minimum standards for financial record keeping by trustees.
