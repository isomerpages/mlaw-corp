From 1 February 2008, foreigners may enter Singapore to carry out arbitration and mediation activities here without a Work Pass. This applies to all persons providing services related to the arbitration or mediation, such as arbitrators and legal counsel.

This exemption was recently announced by the Ministry of Manpower. It complements the Ministry of Law's efforts to grow and strengthen the international arbitration and mediation industries in Singapore, by minimising the administrative demands on foreigners performing such work here.
