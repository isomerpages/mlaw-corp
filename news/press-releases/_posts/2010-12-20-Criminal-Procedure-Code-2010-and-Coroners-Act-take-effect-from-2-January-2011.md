1. The Criminal Procedure Code 2010 and Coroners Act 2010 will come into force on 2 January 2011.

2. The Criminal Procedure Code 2010 introduces, among other things, a formalised criminal discovery framework, and gives the Courts the power to impose a range of community based sentences.

3. The Coroners Act 2010 changes the present fault-finding nature of a Coroner’s Inquiry to a fact-finding one, widens the technical expertise available to the Coroner, and re-scopes the Coroner’s jurisdiction, giving it a clearer focus.
