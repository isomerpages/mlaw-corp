1. The Registry of Moneylenders, a department under the Ministry of Law, brought charges in the State Courts on 12 June 2017 against Tan Kim Wah Steven (陈 金 华), 57 years old, the sole director and shareholder of the moneylending company, WST Credit Pte Ltd.

2. WST Credit Pte Ltd held a moneylending licence from 28 October 2010 to 27 October 2017. The licence was not renewed after 27 October 2017.

3. On 20 November 2017, Tan pleaded guilty in the State Courts and was convicted on twenty five out of seventy five charges for offences under Section 24(7) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) for recklessly furnishing false information to the Registrar on the annual income of borrowers.

4. Tan was sentenced in the State Courts to a total fine of $187,500 (in default 50 weeks’ imprisonment).

5. Forty-four licensed moneylenders or their officers have been convicted and fined for offences under the Moneylenders Act since 2011 (see **<u>Annex</u>**). 

6. The Registry carries out regular inspections on licensed moneylenders. Where breaches of moneylending laws are found, enforcement measures are taken, including the suspension or revocation of licences, forfeiture of security deposits, warnings and prosecutions. Those convicted of breaches of the Moneylenders Act and Rules face a fine of up to $40,000 and/or an imprisonment term of up to two years on each charge.
