**Dr Tan Wu Meng (Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC)** 

**<b><u>Question</u></b>** 
<br>To ask the Minister for Law whether the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals can be empowered to make recommendations or require medical assessments for the claimant and respondent involved in a dispute should there be a substantial cause to believe that the respective individual is suffering from a significant
medical condition which may lead to harm to themselves or others if left untreated.

**<b><u>Oral Answer:</u></b>** 

{:start="1"} 
1.  The CDRT takes a multi-faceted approach to managing cases where there is reason to believe that a party may be suffering from a medical condition, that may have contributed to a neighbour dispute.

{:start="2"} 
2.  In appropriate cases, the CDRT may require court psychologists and counsellors from the State Courts’ Centre for Specialist Services (“CSS”) to make a preliminary assessment of an individual’s mental
health, if there are signs to suggest that the individual may have an underlying mental health condition. If the individual refuses to attend the counselling session, the CDRT may require the individual to attend counselling.

{:start="3"} 
3.  The CSS can then provide input to the Judge on whether the individual would benefit from a referral to a psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health. In appropriate cases, the CSS may also encourage the individual to approach one of the Family Service Centres or the Agency for Integrated Care to seek referrals for medical care or social services.

4.  Where appropriate, for example, where the person has no criminal history, the alleged offence is not serious, and the person’s culpability is lowered as a result of his mental condition or disability, the Public Prosecutor may decide to issue a warning, instead of charging the person. This may, in some cases, also involve a referral for treatment at facilities such as the Institute of Mental Health.

{:start="5"} 
5.  If the Public Prosecutor decides to charge the person, the Public Prosecutor’s charging and sentencing position may be calibrated to take into account the person’s mental condition or disability.

{:start="6"} 
6.  To illustrate: In a 2020 case, a 21-year-old offender committed offences of theft of an SCDF vehicle, cheating and causing hurt to another person by performing a rash act. He was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, a serious form of long-term major mental illness, which contributed to his offending. The Prosecution decided to charge him, considering that the offences were not minor. However, taking into account his mental condition, the Prosecution submitted for a mandatory treatment order to be imposed against the offender, which required the offender to undergo psychiatric treatment in lieu of imprisonment or a fine.

{:start="7"} 
7.  Ultimately, the Public Prosecutor’s exercise of discretion as to whether to charge a person, including a person with a mental condition or disability, is a fact-dependent exercise.
