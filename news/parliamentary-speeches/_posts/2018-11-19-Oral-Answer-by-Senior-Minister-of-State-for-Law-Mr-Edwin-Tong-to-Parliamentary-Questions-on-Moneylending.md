**<u>Oral Answer</u>**


1. Mr Darryl David and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked for statistics on foreign domestic workers (FDWs) who have taken loans from licensed and unlicensed moneylenders. Mr David and Mr Sitoh also asked if the Ministry of Law intends to place any restrictions on the FDWs taking such loans.
 
2. Let me deal with both these questions together.

<u>Recent Borrowing Trends</u>

{:start="3"}
3. The number of FDWs who took loans from licensed moneylenders was approximately 1,500 in 2016, 12,000 in 2017, and 28,000 in the first half of 2018.

{:start="4"}
4. Moneylending regulations do not formally define a “loan default”. However, estimates based on Moneylenders Credit Bureau (MLCB) data from 2016 to the first half of 2018 show that the majority of FDWs have repaid their loans from licensed moneylenders.

{:start="5"}
5. The Police has also observed more foreigners residing in Singapore, including FDWs, borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders.

<u>Enhancing Borrower Protections</u>

<ol start="6">
<li>There are currently several measures to protect all individuals who borrow from licensed moneylenders. For example, the Moneylenders Rules permit a licensed moneylender to charge only the following for each loan:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First, an upfront administrative fee of up to 10%; </li>
<li>Interest of up to 4% per month; </li>
<li>Late interest of up to 4% per month; and </li>
<li>Late fees of up to $60 per month.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="7"}
7. The Registrar of Moneylenders had issued Directions to regulate moneylenders’ activities. In particular, moneylenders are prohibited from advertising their loans to members of the public via mobile text messages or emails. Moneylenders are also prohibited from conducting abusive practices such as repeatedly “rolling over” existing loans to charge the administrative fee multiple times even though no new credit is issued; or offering split loans so that late fees can be charged multiple times per loan, each month.

{:start="8"}
8. In view of the recent increase in foreigners borrowing from moneylenders, on 4 October 2018, the Ministry of Law announced two measures to strengthen protections for FDWs and other foreigners residing in Singapore from the effects of over-borrowing.

<ol start="9">
<li> First, the Ministry will impose aggregate loan caps to limit the total amount that any foreigner residing in Singapore can borrow from licensed moneylenders. The caps were first announced for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents under the Moneylenders (Amendment) Bill in January this year, and the caps are:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Individuals earning up to $20,000 a year may borrow up to $3,000; and </li>
 
<li>Individuals earning $20,000 or more a year may borrow up to six times of their monthly income. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="10"} 
10. Both caps will be extended to all foreigners residing in Singapore. In addition, there will also be a lower cap of $1,500 for all foreigners residing in Singapore who earn less than $10,000 annually.

{:start="11"}
11. Second, the Ministry will also introduce a self-exclusion framework for all individuals who borrow from licensed moneylenders. Both Singapore residents and foreigners may apply for self-exclusion. Licensed moneylenders will be prohibited from lending to self-excluded individuals.

{:start="12"}
12. This framework will help individuals to control their borrowing habits, and to participate in debt assistance schemes administered by voluntary welfare organisations which typically also require self-exclusion.
 
{:start="13"} 
13. The Ministry of Law, together with the Ministry of Manpower and the Singapore Police Force, will continue to monitor the situation following the implementation of these measures, and will assess if more stringent measures are necessary.
