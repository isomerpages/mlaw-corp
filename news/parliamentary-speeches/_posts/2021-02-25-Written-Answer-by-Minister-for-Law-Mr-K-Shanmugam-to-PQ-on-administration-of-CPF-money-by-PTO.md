Ms Raeesah Khan (Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC)
  
**<b><u>Question</u></b>**  
To ask the Minister for Law (a) what is the current process to assist (i) less technologically savvy individuals (ii) less language-able and (iii) persons with disabilities, in applying for the administration of CPF money after the death of a family member; (b) what is the rationale for the fees charged by the Public Trustee in the administration of un-nominated CPF money being non-waivable; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider waiving these fees or charging a flat fee for individuals/households below a defined income and property value threshold.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>**

1. The Public Trustee’s Office (“PTO”) provides a service to family members to administer the CPF monies of their loved one who has passed away without making a CPF nomination.  Individuals can apply for the service online.  Those who need assistance with the electronic application can be assisted in-person by e-helpers who are conversant in multiple languages and dialects at the Ministry of Law Services Centre. Those who are unable to make their way to the Services Centre, such as those with mobility difficulties, may contact the PTO. Where necessary, PTO officers can make home visits to provide assistance.

2. The Public Trustee has to impose a fee to cover the cost of administering the un-nominated CPF monies, which includes tracing the deceased’s next-of-kin, identifying all eligible beneficiaries and establishing the familial relationship between the beneficiaries and deceased. The fee is deducted from the un-nominated CPF monies. The Public Trustee can waive the fee in part or full, taking into consideration supporting documents that evidence the applicant’s financial circumstances, and has done so for deserving cases.

3. To allow their CPF monies to be distributed to preferred beneficiaries faster and without incurring fees, we strongly encourage all members to make their CPF nominations and update it as their life circumstances change. They can do so via the <a href="https://cpf.gov.sg/MakeCPFNom" target="new">CPF Board’s online nomination service</a> or visit the CPF Service Centres, where the Customer Service Executives can help in the nomination process and act as their witnesses.
