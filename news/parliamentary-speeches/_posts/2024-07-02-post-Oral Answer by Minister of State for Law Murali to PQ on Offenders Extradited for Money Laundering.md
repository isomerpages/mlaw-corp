<b><u>Question for Oral Answer</u></b>

<b>Ms Sylvia Lim (Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law for those convicted in Singapore for their involvement in the billion-dollar money laundering case, whether there have been indications from other governments to the Singapore authorities that the offenders will face investigations into the relevant predicate offences upon being deported to their home countries.

<b><u>Oral Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	The Honourable Member may be referring to deportation in the sense of extradition. If that is the case, extradition will only take place when there is an extradition treaty in force, and a valid request has been made under the treaty.

{:start="2"}
2. There are no extradition proceedings here. In the absence of extradition, the position is that after conviction and serving of sentence, the offenders will be required to leave Singapore. As at end-June 2024, eight of the ten convicted foreigners have been deported and are barred from re-entering Singapore. This similarly applies to the remaining two after they finish serving their sentences. These foreigners can go to any country which their passports or travel documents allow them to go to, as explained by the Honourable Minister of State Sun Xueling. What happens to them in those countries, or in their countries of nationality, is not within our control.
