<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

**Ms Ng Ling Ling (Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio GRC):** 

<b><u>Question</u></b>
To ask the Minister for Law (a) in each of the past three years, how many applications for mediation of disputes between neighbours have been made to the Community Mediation Centre; (b) how many of such applications have led to actual
mediations being conducted; and (c) what percentage of the mediations conducted led to amicable resolutions between the neighbours.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	In 2021 and 2022, the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) received about 1,900 and 1,400 applications respectively involving disputes between neighbours. In the period from January to November 2023, the CMC received about 1,200 of such cases.

2.	Of the cases registered in 2021 and 2022, 404 and 300 cases were mediated respectively. Of the cases registered from January to November 2023, 195 of such cases were mediated as at end November 2023, with some cases pending mediation. As mediation at the CMC is currently voluntary, less than 30% of such cases proceed to mediation, although more than 80% of such mediated cases are amicably resolved.
