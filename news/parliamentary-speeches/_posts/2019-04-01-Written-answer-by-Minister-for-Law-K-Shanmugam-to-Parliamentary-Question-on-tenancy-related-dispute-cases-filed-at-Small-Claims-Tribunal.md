**Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC)**

**<u>Question</u>**

To ask the Minister for Law (a) what percentage of cases filed at the Small Claims Tribunal in the past three years are claims arising from tenancy-related disputes; (b) what proportion of such tenancy-related cases are filed by Singaporeans; and (c) whether there are plans to review existing laws to assist landlords and tenants in preventing or resolving tenancy disputes.

**<u>Written Answer:</u>**

1. The Small Claims Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear a wide variety of disputes. This includes claims relating to tenancy disputes arising from any contract for the rental of residential premises that does not exceed two years.

 

2. Based on statistics provided by the State Courts, an average of 10,414 cases were filed at the Small Claims Tribunals each year, from 2016 to 2018. Out of these cases, about nine percent on average were tenancy-related claims. The State Courts does not track the number of such cases which are filed by Singaporeans.

 

3. We recently amended the Small Claims Tribunals Act to allow the Tribunals to hear more claims in a quicker and more cost-effective manner, as well as to strengthen the Tribunalâ€™s case-management powers. One of the enhancements is to allow a Tribunal to order the remedy of delivery of vacant possession. This will allow a landlord to apply to seek that a tenant deliver vacant possession of rented premises in cases of unpaid rent. This will give the Tribunals a greater suite of options to assist landlord and tenants in resolving tenancy disputes.
