<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

**Mr Chua Kheng Wee Louis (Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC)** 

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law whether the Government is considering imposing a limit to credit facilities and capping the fees and effective interest rates charged by platform operators to platform workers under their financing programme. 

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the current framework for the regulation of moneylenders in Singapore, a platform operator may lend money to its platform workers as an exempt moneylender under the Moneylenders Act. In order to be granted an exemption, the proposed lending must be assessed to have potential benefits to borrowers, such as providing an avenue of safe credit to meet a specific need, while also having sufficient safeguards in place to protect borrowers. 

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GFin, a subsidiary of Grab, is the only platform operator currently permitted to lend money specifically to Grabâ€™s platform workers under this exemption framework. The Government imposes on GFin various restrictions on lending, as conditions of the exemption, including limits on permitted fees and debt service ratios, which are generally more stringent than those applying to licensed moneylenders. There are also legislated limits on credit facilities, in particular caps on the loan quantum, for exempt moneylenders. Beyond these, GFin must additionally implement safeguards, such as an internal credit scoring system to assess the maximum loan a platform worker can take and various support initiatives for platform workers facing challenges in making repayments.
