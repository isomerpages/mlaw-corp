**MR EDWIN TONG**<br>
**MINISTER FOR LAW**<br>

{:start="1"}
1. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) will continue to uphold the Rule of Law and public trust in Singapore’s legal system. We will improve access to justice, strengthen Singapore’s position as a global legal and intellectual property (IP) hub, and make better use of state assets to support the country’s social and economic needs.

<b><u>Upholding the Rule of Law and Expanding Access to Justice</u></b>

{:start="2"}
2. The Rule of Law is key to public trust and Singapore’s continued progress. We will enhance our civil and criminal justice systems to meet changing societal needs, premised on a strong foundation in the Rule of Law. We will take steps to promote responsible online behaviour and create a safer digital space as social media and Artificial Intelligence grow in prevalence. MinLaw will study the need for a new agency to better support victims of online harm with an appropriate framework for relief.

{:start="3"}
3. MinLaw will continue to make laws, legal processes, and court procedures easier for Singaporeans to understand and use. We are reviewing digital Wills, improving how civil judgments are enforced, and giving courts stronger powers to trace debtors’ assets. The Maintenance Enforcement Process will be expanded to deter non-payment. In family justice, we will deepen the therapeutic justice approach to support healing and family well-being, to reinforce social and legal outcomes.

{:start="4"}
4. MinLaw will strengthen our insolvency framework to support economic stability. The new Simplified Insolvency Programme 2.0 will offer faster help for struggling businesses while protecting creditors. We are also reviewing the Debt Repayment Scheme to reduce abuse and help debtors better manage their finances.

{:start="5"}
5. Access to justice is a core part of Singapore’s social safety net. MinLaw will expand outreach and support for civil legal aid and criminal defence aid, working with lawyers, social service agencies, volunteers, and the broader community. We are enhancing the Community Disputes Management Framework and improving tribunal processes to help neighbours resolve disputes more quickly and peacefully.

<b><u>Growing Singapore as a Global Legal and IP Hub</u></b>

{:start="6"}
6. Singapore’s reputation as a trusted legal services hub strengthens our global standing. MinLaw will continue to build thought leadership and deepen international partnerships through events like the Singapore Convention Week. We will also review our international arbitration laws to keep Singapore competitive for dispute resolution.

{:start="7"}
7. MinLaw will maintain a strong core of Singapore lawyers and legal practices, complemented by foreign practitioners and other industry experts, to sustain Singapore’s competitive advantage. We will support the growth of all legal professionals by strengthening legal education across the legal industry, updating training requirements, and rolling out a new skills framework developed with the legal sector. Our Legal Innovation and Future-Readiness Transformation Initiative will help law firms adopt legaltech solutions and embrace the use of AI and technology to support their work.

{:start="8"}
8. We are refreshing our IP Strategy 2030 to attract more IP and intangible asset (IA) activity. The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) will work with the World Intellectual Property Organization to help businesses grow globally through IP Management Clinics. IA valuation guidelines will be developed to help firms protect and monetise their IP. We will also introduce new guidelines for using copyrighted works in AI development to support innovation and protect creators’ rights.

<b><u>Optimising State Assets for Singapore's Future</u></b>

{:start="9"}
9. The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) will work with community and private partners to optimise state assets to meet national needs, including to drive social outcomes through innovative use and re-use of spaces. Examples include the multi-generational co-living space at Commune @ Henderson and the social innovation hub at The Foundry.

{:start="10"}
10. SLA is also developing a Digital Conveyancing Portal to digitalise property transactions to improve convenience, transparency, and security for buyers, sellers, law firms, banks, and real estate professionals.

<b><u>Conclusion</u></b>

{:start="11"}
11. MinLaw remains committed to engaging Singaporeans and working closely with the legal fraternity and stakeholders to strengthen access to legal services and grow opportunities in the legal sector. Together, we will realise our vision: A Trusted Legal System; A Trusted Singapore.
