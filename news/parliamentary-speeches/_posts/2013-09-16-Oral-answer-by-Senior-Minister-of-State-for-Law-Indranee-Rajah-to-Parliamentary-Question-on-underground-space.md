**Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Holland-Bukit Timah GRC**

**<u>Question</u>**    
To ask the Minister for Law in light of plans to develop underground space more extensively, what is the Government's position on the ownership of underground space in Singapore.


**<u>Answer</u>**    

Mdm Speaker,


The Minister for National Development discussed recently some of the possibilities that could be explored: underground transport hubs, pedestrian links, cycling lanes, utility plants, storage and research facilities, industrial uses, shopping areas and public spaces. This will make Singapore an even more vibrant and exciting city.

On the question regarding ownership of underground land, our law assumes that the owner of the surface land, also owns the underground space, to a depth that is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the property.

MND’s objectives are important ones. MinLaw will work with the industry, on how these objectives can be realised, and will in this context, also consider the experiences of other countries on what would be a sensible approach. Some countries, for example, allow owners of the surface land to have a certain depth of underground space for their use, while enabling deeper subterranean space to be used for underground projects. We will consult stakeholders and set up a sound framework for agencies to realise the vision of more space to live, work and play.
