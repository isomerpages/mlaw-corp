Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC) 
  
**<b><u>Question</u></b>**  

To ask the Minister for Law (a) in each year from 2020 to 2021, how many applications to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) are filed; (b) of these, how many applicants have indicated that they have attended mediation with the respondents in the six months preceding the CDRT application; and (c) how many remedies were eventually granted.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>**  
 
{:start="1"}
1.	A total of 448 applications to the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) were filed from 2020 to 2021, with 211 applications filed in 2020 and 237 applications filed in 2021. 

{:start="2"}
2. 	Of the 448 applications filed, 102 applications involved applicants who had attended mediation at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) in the six months prior to filing the CDRT application. This is based on applicantsâ€™ responses as recorded in the pre-filing assessment that takes place before they file a CDRT application. Applicants may have attended mediation with their respondents at other venues apart from CMC, but such data is unavailable. 

{:start="3"}
3.	As at 31 December 2021, 383 of the 448 applications have concluded. The outcomes of the 383 concluded applications are set out as follows:<br> 
    (a)	 51 consent orders (i.e., orders where parties agree to an order granted by the CDRT either at the pre-trial or trial stage), 22 default orders (i.e., orders granted in the absence of the respondent), and 17 adjudicated orders (i.e., orders granted after a hearing or trial on the merits of the case) were granted by the CDRT.<br> 
    (b)	The remaining 293 applications were either withdrawn or discontinued by the applicant, or dismissed by the CDRT.
