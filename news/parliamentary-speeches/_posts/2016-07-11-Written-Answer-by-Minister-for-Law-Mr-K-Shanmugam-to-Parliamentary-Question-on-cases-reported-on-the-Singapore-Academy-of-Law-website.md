**<u>Question: </u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law (a) how does the Singapore Academy of Law decide on the cases to be reported on its website; (b) what is the duration for which the cases will remain on its website; (c) what are the requirements for their removal; and (d) whether Court of Appeal cases heard in overseas jurisdictions are included in the website or only those heard in Singapore.

**<u>Answer:</u>**

1. The Singapore Academy of Law (“SAL”) manages two websites which contain judgments, namely the Singapore Law Watch website at [www.singaporelawwatch.sg](http://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/) (“the SLW Website”) and the Singapore Law website at [www.singaporelaw.sg](http://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/) (“the SgLaw Website”).

<li>  According to SAL:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> All judgments from the Supreme Court of Singapore are published on the SLW Website and the SgLaw Website. There is no selection process.</li>
<li>Judgments from the Supreme Court of Singapore are published on the SLW Website for a period of three months, and on the SgLaw Website in perpetuity. </li>
<li>Judgments are redacted or not published only where this is required by law, or by an order of Court. </li>
<li>The SLW Website and the SgLaw Website only publish judgments from the Supreme Court of Singapore. They do not publish judgments from other jurisdictions. </li>
