<b><u>Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament</u></b><br>
<b>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b><br>
To ask the Minister for Law (a) how many enforcement applications were filed in respect of the 233 Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal orders issued between 2020 and 2024; (b) what percentage of these applications resulted in an enforcement order; and (c) whether the Ministry will introduce a mechanism for the court to direct agencies to verify and monitor compliance with non-monetary orders on-site.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b><br>
{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;Between 2020 and 2024, 69 applications for Special Directions and 13 applications for Exclusion Orders were filed.&nbsp;

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;Of these applications filed, 24 Special Directions and 2 Exclusion Orders were made. This means that around 30 percent of enforcement applications resulted in an enforcement order. Due to the small number of applications involved, caution should be exercised in interpreting these percentages which are subject to wide statistical fluctuations.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;Orders made by the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) are Court orders that must be complied with. The breach of a CDRT order constitutes contempt of Court. The breach of a Special Direction or Exclusion Order is also an offence punishable by a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment for up to 3 months.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;CDRT proceedings are private actions between private parties. As such, the claimants in private actions would typically monitor compliance with court orders issued in their favour, and decide how to proceed. If a CDRT Order has been breached, a claimant can apply for a Special Direction to enforce the CDRT Order. If a Special Direction has been breached, a claimant can further apply for an Exclusion Order to exclude the respondent from his or her residence. In severe noise nuisance and hoarding cases in the pilot town of Tampines, the Community Relations Unit can assist by using its investigation powers to verify the breach of a CDRT Order or a Special Direction.
