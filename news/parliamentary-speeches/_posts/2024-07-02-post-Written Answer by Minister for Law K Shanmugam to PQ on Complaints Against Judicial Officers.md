<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Member of Parliament for Mountbatten SMC)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry has data on the number of complaints that have been made against judicial officers in the State Courts and Supreme Court for breach of the judicial code of conduct over the past three years; and (b) if so, how many complaints have there been.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	The Ministry of Law does not keep track of the number of complaints that have been made against judicial officers in the State Courts and Supreme Court for breach of the judicial code of conduct over the past three years. I understand from the Judiciary that in the past three years since January 2021, there have been a small number of complaints against Judges, Judicial Commissioners and Judicial Service Officers relating to the Singapore Judiciaryâ€™s Codes of Conduct. One of them is pending determination. The others were found to be not substantiated.
