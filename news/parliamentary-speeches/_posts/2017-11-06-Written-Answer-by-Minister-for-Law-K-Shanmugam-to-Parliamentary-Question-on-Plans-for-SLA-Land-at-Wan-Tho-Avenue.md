**Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Member of Parliament for Potong Pasir)**

<u>Question:</u>  
To ask the Minister for Law what are SLA's plans for the 9,000 square metres of land that St John's Home for Elderly Persons currently leases and occupies at Wan Tho Avenue once the land is returned to SLA upon its lease expiry in 2021.


<u>Answer:</u>  
The 0.9-hectare parcel which currently forms part of the premises occupied by the St John's Home for Elderly Persons (SJH) will return to the State upon expiry of the tenancy in 2021. This land parcel is currently zoned Civic and Community Institution in URA's Master Plan. Options being studied by agencies include introducing new community and social facilities that could serve the needs of the larger population over time. The detailed plans will be firmed up in due course. SJH is currently redeveloping and consolidating its operations within a separate 0.33-hectare parcel that it holds on a 30-year lease till 2045. Agencies will continue to work with SJH to ensure a smooth transition.
