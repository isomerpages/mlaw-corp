**Patrick Tay Teck Guan, Member of Parliament for West Coast GRC**

**<u>Question:</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law since the coming into force of the Protection from Harassment Act until 31 May 2016, what has been (i) the total number of cases filed, mediated and resolved (ii) the total number of cases involving workplace bullying/harassment (iii) the total number of cases involving sexual harassment and (iv) the total number of cases involving workplace sexual harassment.

**<u>Answer:</u>**    
The Protection from Harassment Act ("the Act") was introduced to strengthen harassment laws and provide a range of criminal sanctions, civil and self-help remedies to better protect people from harassment and related anti-social behaviour. Cases filed under the Act are managed with a view to assist parties to explore ways to resolve the issues effectively and promptly without proceeding to trial, including the use of counselling and mediation.
<br>  
The Act took effect on 15 November 2014. According to the State Courts, as at 30 April 2016, 203 applications for Protection Orders have been filed. This includes applications by victims of sexual and workplace harassment. However, the State Courts does not track the specific number of cases for each type of case.
<br>  
Of the 203 applications filed, 32 cases were sent to the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution for mediation as at 30 April 2016. 63 Protection Orders and 55 Expedited Protection Orders have been granted. 73 applications were withdrawn. Out of the 63 Protection Orders granted, 38 were granted by consent, constituting more than half of the orders that were granted. This suggests that a good number of cases were resolved amicably. The remaining applications have either been dismissed or struck off, or are pending resolution as at 30 April 2016.
