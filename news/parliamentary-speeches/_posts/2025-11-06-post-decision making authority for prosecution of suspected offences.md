<b><u>Name and constituency of Member of Parliament</u></b><br>
<b>Mr Fadli Fawzi (Member for Parliament for Aljuned GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b><br>
To ask the Minister of Law whether the assessment and decision to prosecute suspected offences under Part 9 of the Administration of Muslim Law are cleared within Attorney-General's Chambers at the (i) Director level or (ii) 
higher management level; and (b) whether these offences (i) are considered as more serious or sensitive crimes or (ii) requires Attorney-General's express consent to prosecute.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b><br>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp; Under Article 35(8) of the Constitution, the Attorney-General, as Public Prosecutor, exercises prosecutorial discretion. This includes the assessment and decision to prosecute suspected offences. Such decisions are made independently.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;The processes by which the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) assesses and makes its prosecutorial decisions – including whether a matter is reviewed at Director or higher management levels – are operational matters within the AGC’s purview to determine independently and for AGC to decide based on the circumstances of each case and its assessment of the public interest.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp; Under the Administration of Muslim Law Act, there is no provision requiring the 
Attorney-General’s express consent to prosecute offences under Part 9.
