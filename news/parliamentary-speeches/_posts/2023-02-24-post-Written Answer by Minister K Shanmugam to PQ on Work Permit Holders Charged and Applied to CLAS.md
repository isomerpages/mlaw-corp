Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Member of Parliament for Nee Soon GRC)
  
**<b><u>Question</u></b>** 

To ask the Minister for Law in each year for the past five
years (a) how many work permit holders have been charged with crimes; (b) how many have applied for the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS); (c) how many have been offered aid under CLAS; and (d) what are the top three reasons that CLAS applications by work permit holders have been unsuccessful..

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b> 

{:start="1"}
1.  The number of work permit holders (WPHs) charged with crimes for the past five years can be found in Table 1. These figures cover offences charged by the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Immigration and Checkpoints
Authority (ICA) which are under various legislation such as the Penal Code, National Registration Act, Passport Act and Immigration Act..

**<b>Table 1: Number of WPHs Charged for Offences by SPF and ICA</b>**

|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Number of WPHs Charged|975|970|743|771|759|

{:start="2"}
2.  The Member’s questions on the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS) should be properly directed to Pro Bono SG (PBSG), which administers CLAS. PBSG is a
company limited by guarantee, with the Law Society as their sole member. The Government funds 75% of CLAS’ general operating costs, which goes towards staff
salaries and overheads. The rest of the costs incurred, including to defend foreigners who need criminal legal aid, are supported by private donations. Foreigners who seek legal aid under CLAS must pass their means* and merits tests.

{:start="3"}
3.  CLAS does not track foreigner applications by the type of permit held. Based on what PBSG has told us, the number of foreigners who have applied to and been offered aid under CLAS, for the past five years, can be found in Table 2.

**<b>Table 1: Breakdown of Cases Registered at the Community Mediation Centre</b>**

|                |2017|2018|2019|2020|2021|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
|Total number of registered cases|1095|1066|1016|1851|2060|
|<i>Total number of voluntary cases registered</i>|780|852|799|1710|1954|
|<i>Total number of voluntary referrals*</i>|325|361|345|585|745|
|<i>Total number of Court-referred cases registered</i>|315|214|217|141|106|
|Total number of mediated cases|429|386|395|473|474|
|<i>Total number of voluntary cases that were mediated</i>|181|216|277|373|417|
|Settlement rate of mediated cases|78%|81%|79%|85%|84%|
|Total number of voluntary cases that were not mediated (due to parties declining or failing to respond)^|528|546|486|1082|1345|

<u>Notes</u>:
<br>*Voluntary referrals refer to cases referred to the CMC from public agencies and other organisations.
<br>^There are other reasons why parties did not undergo mediation including parties withdrawing from mediation, settling on their own, etc. 

{:start="4"}
4.  Cases are also referred to the CMC by the Magistrate’s Courts and Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals. Attendance for such mediation is mandatory. Such cases make up about 14% of registered cases.

{:start="5"}

5.  Whilst 88% of neighbour dispute cases mediated at the CMC were settled in 2021, the overall settlement rate at the CMC over the last five years was about 80%.



{:start="7"}

7.  As the Government has stated several times, there has been a low take-up rate for community mediation. This is due to several factors, including the fact that community mediation is voluntary, and parties are not obliged to proceed to mediation, particularly if they are the ones whose conduct is in question. The Government had said earlier this year that it is considering what can be done to increase the participation in mediation.

{:start="8"}

8.  The CMC encourages residents who face relational disputes to attempt mediation at the CMC, so that they would have an opportunity to discuss mutually acceptable solutions.
