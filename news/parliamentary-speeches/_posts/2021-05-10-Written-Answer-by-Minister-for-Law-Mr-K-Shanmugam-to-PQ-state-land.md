1.	The tenure of sites sold through the Government Land Sales Programme typically depends on factors such as the type of use and site-specific planning considerations. For example, the tenure for residential, commercial, hospitality and white sites is typically 99 years, while industrial sites are generally sold on tenures between 20 to 30 years.
