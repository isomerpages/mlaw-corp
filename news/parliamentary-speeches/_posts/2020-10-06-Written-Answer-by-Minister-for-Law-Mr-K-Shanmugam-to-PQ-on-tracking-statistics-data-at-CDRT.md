Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC) 

**<b><u>Question</u></b>**  
To ask the Minister for Law whether the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) will consider tracking (i) the number of neighbour disputes that had been previously mediated at the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) and (ii) data on the specific number of orders that relate to damages, injunctions, specific performances, or apologies.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>**  

{:start="1"}
1. In 2015, the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (“CDRT”) were established as specialised courts to deal with neighbour disputes with the intention that they be faster, less costly and less adversarial than traditional civil proceedings, so as to better preserve relationships between the neighbours.

2. State Courts currently does not have readily available information on the number of CDRT cases that had previously been mediated at the Community Mediation Centre (“CMC”) prior to filing at the CDRT. However, the CDRT requires all applicants to fill in a pre-filing assessment form, where applicants must state whether they had attended mediation with the respondents in the six months preceding the CDRT application.
