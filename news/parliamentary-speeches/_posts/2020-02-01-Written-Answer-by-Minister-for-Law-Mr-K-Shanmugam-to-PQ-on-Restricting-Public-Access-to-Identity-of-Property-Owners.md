Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio GRC)

**<b><u>Question</u></b>**  
To ask the Minister for Law (a) in view of the Personal Data Protection Act, whether the Ministry will consider restricting public access to the identity of property owners in Singapore; and (b) whether any such disclosure ought to be subject to the consent of the property owner or through an order of court.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>**  

{:start="1"}
1.	 The Land Titles Register (“land register”) is a public record of land ownership and all registered property transactions. It enables property ownership to be easily ascertained, in order to prevent fraudulent property transactions and other undesirable outcomes.

{:start="2"}
2.	While a title search does not require the consent of the property owner, it can only be performed using details such as the property address, lot number and title reference number. It is not possible to retrieve information on the properties an individual owns, by submitting his name or identification number on the search portal.
