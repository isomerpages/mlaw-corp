**Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Member for Sembawang GRC**


**<u>Question:</u>**  
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law (a) how many undischarged bankrupts are there presently; (b) how many of them are Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs); and (c) how many of them are unemployed.


*Number of Bankrupts*

1. As at 29 Feb this year, there were 25,961 undischarged bankrupts. 

*Number of PMET bankrupts*

{:start="2"}
2. From the data available, of the total number of bankrupts, 3,703 of them belong in the Professionals, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMETs) category.  These bankrupts either held PMET jobs prior to bankruptcy or are currently working as PMETs.  The proportion of bankrupts who are PMETs has remained stable over the past 3 years at about 14%.  The number of new bankrupts who held or are holding PMET jobs   declined from 546 in 2005 to 441 in 2007. 

*PMET bankrupts who are unemployed*

{:start="3"}
3. Of the 3,703 bankrupts who are in the PMET category, 960 were unemployed at the time they were made bankrupt.  For bankrupts who provided updates on their employment status, we know that there are currently around 80 PMET bankrupts who are unemployed. 

{:start="4"}
4. My Ministry will continue to monitor these trends closely.
