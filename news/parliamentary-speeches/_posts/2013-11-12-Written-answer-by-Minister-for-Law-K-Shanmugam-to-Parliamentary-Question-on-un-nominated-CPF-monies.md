**Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song, Non-Constituency Member**

**<u>Question</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law (a) in each of the last 10 years, how many applications to claim un-nominated CPF monies are made to the Public Trustee; (b) how many next-of-kin (NOK) of deceased persons with un-nominated CPF monies had to wait (i) between four weeks and six months and (ii) more than six months, for the Public Trustee to distribute the CPF monies; and (c) what assistance does the Insolvency and Public Trustee’s Office provide to NOK who have difficulty making applications to claim un-nominated CPF monies.


**<u>Answer</u>**  
1. The Public Trustee’s Office has, in the last few years, received an average of 4,500 applications per year to claim un-nominated CPF monies belonging to deceased persons. From 2008 to September 2013, there were a total of 26,006 such applications.

2. The Public Trustee’s Office has, since FY2011, targeted to pay out the un-nominated CPF monies within four weeks from the date on which all documents verifying the beneficiaries’ entitlement are received and has been tracking that benchmark. The Public Trustee’s Office has met this target for more than 95% of the cases since then.

3. As soon as the Public Trustee receives the un-nominated monies from the CPF Board, a letter will be sent out to notify the next-of-kin and provide information on how to make a claim as well as the list of documents required.

4. Applications to claim un-nominated CPF monies may be made online or at the Public Trustee’s Office. The Public Trustee’s Office also maintains an online portal which provides information for next-of-kin and a guide to assist applicants in making the application. Those who need further assistance may also engage the services of e-helpers.
