Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC)
  
**<b><u>Question</u></b>**  

To ask the Minister for Law whether there are any plans to streamline the process of making simple wills so that more residents, especially the low-income, can have their wills made and safely deposited with minimal expenses and administrative hurdles.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>**  

{:start="1"}
1.  We encourage members of the public to make a will, as this will give them greater peace of mind that their affairs will be better taken care of after they pass on.  

{:start="2"}
2.	They can either write their will themselves if they are at least 21 years old and of sound mind, or engage a third party to help them write one. 

{:start="3"}
3.	To help those who wish to write their own wills, we are looking at making information on wills and probate more readily available on digital platforms, and to set out the information in a way that is clear and intuitive to laypersons who have no knowledge of the law.  In January 2020, we launched the Government’s “My Legacy” portal, which provides step-by-step guidance on how to make and deposit a will, and how to settle the estate of a deceased loved one. It also provides a secure Vault feature – which is accessible using SingPass – which helps citizens to consolidate a record of their assets, important documents, and personal information (including where their will is located, Advance Care Plan, and Lasting Power of Attorney).  

{:start="4"}
4.	We will continue to expand and improve the features offered by “My Legacy” and make this available and accessible to Singaporeans.

{:start="5"}
5.	Individuals can also engage lawyers to help them to write their wills.  Those who are lower-income can reach out to the Legal Aid Bureau (“LAB”) for assistance. The LAB has been helping Singaporeans with limited means with the drafting of their wills. 

{:start="6"}
6.	Community organisations also offer subsidised will-writing services for low-income residents with limited means.
