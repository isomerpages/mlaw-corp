<b>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) to date, how many black-and-white properties managed by SLA have had undeveloped state land located adjacent to the property, for which tenants have raised concerns about maintenance; and (b) what is the procedure that SLA follows to resolve such concerns.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"} 
1. From time to time, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) receives feedback, from the tenants of residential State properties it manages and/or other residents in the vicinity, on issues related to vegetated land located within and adjacent to the properties. These include issues relating to public health and safety.

{:start="2"}
2. SLA’s approach to such cases, including whether site clearance is necessary, is to assess each case on its merits, depending on the specific circumstances, and always with a view to safeguarding SLA’s interests as the landlord. 

{:start="3"}
3. SLA will take into consideration, amongst other factors, the nature of the tenants’ public health and safety concerns, the specific tenancy details and how SLA’s interests would be best achieved in the context of the tenancy and its surrounding circumstances. The solution to the issues may also be site-specific. For example, some cases involving mosquito breeding can be resolved through more frequent fogging. However, site clearance may be carried out if the disamenity persists and it is necessary to address public health and safety concerns.

{:start="4"}
4. SLA does not specifically track the number of requests from its tenants, on issues relating to the maintenance of vegetated State land located adjacent to residential State properties.
