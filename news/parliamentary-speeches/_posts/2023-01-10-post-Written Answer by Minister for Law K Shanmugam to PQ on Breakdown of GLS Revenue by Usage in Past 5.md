**Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC)**

**<b><u>Question</u></b>** 
<br>To ask the Minister for Law in each of the past five years, what proportion of Government land sales revenue is attributable to (i) commercial (including hotel and white sites) (ii) industrial (iii) private residential and (iv) public residential (HDB), respectively.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>** 

{:start="1"} 
1.  The Family Justice Courts (FJC) have been working on a  probate e-service that will make the probate process easier and simpler, for applicants with straightforward probate applications.

{:start="2"} 
2.  As announced in March 2022, key features of the probate e-service will include the automatic population of data through integration with MyInfo, and the use of guided questions. Applicants using the e-service will no longer need to file death certificates if the relevant information can be obtained by the e-service directly from a government agency. The FJC is also studying how the application process can be further streamlined, including by reducing the number of steps that an applicant needs to take before the relevant application is granted. The FJC will also explore whether digital signing  capabilities can be added, in future enhancements.

{:start="3"} 
3.  The FJC is engaging stakeholders, including members of the family Bar, on the probate e-service, and will consider their feedback in the final design of the system. 

{:start="4"} 
4.  The FJC currently intends to launch the system in the first half of 2023, although this is subject to developmental progress. The system will initially be used for straightforward probate cases, with capacity progressively ramped up over time.
