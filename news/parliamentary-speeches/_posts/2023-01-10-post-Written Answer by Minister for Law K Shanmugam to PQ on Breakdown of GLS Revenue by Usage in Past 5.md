**Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC)**

**<b><u>Question</u></b>** 
<br>To ask the Minister for Law in each of the past five years, what proportion of Government land sales revenue is attributable to (i) commercial (including hotel and white sites) (ii) industrial (iii) private residential and (iv) public residential (HDB), respectively.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>** 

{:start="1"} 
1.  The sale of State land to the private sector for development is primarily conducted through the Government Land Sales Programme (GLS). The Housing and Development Board (HDB), JTC Corporation, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are appointed as the Government's land sales agents.

{:start="2"} 
2.  From FY2017 to FY2021, sales proceeds of State land from GLS averaged $5.5 billion annually. This includes GLS sites for commercial, industrial1, private residential, mixed-use (such as mixed commercial and residential developments), and other uses. The historical data on tender prices for GLS sites and their specific uses can be found on the HDB, URA, and JTC websites.

3.  The FJC is engaging stakeholders, including members of the family Bar, on the probate e-service, and will consider their feedback in the final design of the system. 

{:start="4"} 
4.  The FJC currently intends to launch the system in the first half of 2023, although this is subject to developmental progress. The system will initially be used for straightforward probate cases, with capacity progressively ramped up over time.
