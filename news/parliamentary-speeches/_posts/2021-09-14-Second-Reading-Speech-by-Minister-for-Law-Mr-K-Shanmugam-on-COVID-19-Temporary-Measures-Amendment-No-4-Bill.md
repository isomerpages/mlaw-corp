**I. Introduction**

{:start="1"}
1. Mr Speaker Sir, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a second time.”

{:start="2"}
2.	The Minister for Finance announced in his Ministerial Statement on 26 July this year that the Government would provide additional 2 weeks of direct rental support for qualifying tenants, owner-occupiers, of privately-owned commercial properties. This was because the tightened safe management measures, under Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) imposed a number of restrictions. 

{:start="3"}
3.	The Minister for Finance also said the Government would consider requiring landlords to provide a matching 2-week rental waiver for eligible tenants.

{:start="4"}
4.	This Bill introduces the legislative framework to implement the mandatory rental waiver by the landlords. 

**II. Rationale for Intervention**

{:start="5"}
5.	Let me briefly explain the rationale behind this Bill.

{:start="6"}
6.	There were two Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) periods: 

   a. 16 May to 13 June 2021.
   
   b. 22 July to 18 August 2021. 
      
{:start="7"}
7.	And the speed at which all of it has happened, has taken many by surprise. If you look at Singapore, on 18 February – DPM presented his Budget Speech with a support package. $5.6 billion, very substantive. At that time, there were 800 confirmed cases outside China.

{:start="8"}
8.	By 26 March, the situation had worsened. There was a second package presented by DPM. This time, $48 billion. At that time, there were 410,000 infections, 18,000 deaths.		

{:start="9"}
9.	11 days later, the situation had worsened again. Yesterday, 6 April, DPM presented the third package to help Singaporeans. We had 1.2 million infections, more than 67,000 dead worldwide. Almost certainly, that’s an understatement of the true figures. 

{:start="10"}
10.	The virus is still tearing through the world. Africa, South Asia, so far have not been badly hit. We can only hope that it stays that way. 

*(B)	Economic impact*

{:start="11"}
11.	The economic impact has been devastating. On 19 March, the Secretary-General of the United Nations said, and I quote: a “global recession – perhaps of record dimensions – is a near certainty”.

{:start="12"}
12.	On 19 March, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) made an assessment that global unemployment could increase by 25 million. On 27 March, eight days later, ILO changed the assessment. Within 8 days, they said unemployment could be far bigger, far deeper, certainly more than 25 million. 

{:start="13"}
13.	Last week, the director of the international department of the People’s Bank of China said, and I quote: “The possibility of a ‘Great Depression’ cannot be ruled out if the epidemic continues to run out of control, and the deterioration of the real economy is compounded by an eruption of financial risks”. 

{:start="14"}
14.	The “Great Depression” – the phrase itself brings to mind one of the most desperate periods America, and the world, went through in the 20th Century. Most of us only know about the Great Depression through books, economic studies. The era, the mood, the desperation, have been vividly captured in literature by people like John Passos, Steinbeck, others.

{:start="15"}
15.	The world has more resources, better understanding, tools, to avoid a similar Great Depression now. But the idea itself, and what it can do to many people’s lives, is quite sobering.

{:start="16"}
16.	The figures are grim. 

a.	In the last two weeks of March, 10 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits. In contrast, during the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis, global unemployment rose by about 22 million. So you can see it in context.

b.	The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has said that the downward pressure on FDI could be 30% to 40% this year and next year. Aviation has collapsed. 

c.	And as of 2 April, nearly 4 billion people, half of the world’s population, were under some form of movement restriction. I think that doesn’t include Singapore’s figures, but that’s probably a rounding error!

{:start="17"}
17.	Other crises have affected economies. Spending goes down. Businesses, jobs are affected. But a lot of activity continues.

{:start="18"}
18.	Here: it’s a hard stop, immediate, by Government orders, to most economic activity, even movement of people. Overnight, as it were. And so the impact is that of an economy literally falling off a cliff in free-fall. That is the difference between this slowdown and others.

{:start="19"}
19.	And ours, a globalised economy, is especially hard-hit. Disruptions to supply chains, flow of manpower. External trade is three times our economy. And of course, large parts of the internal economy are also being closed down.

**III. <u>Response</u>**

{:start="20"}
20.	The response to all of this, to such a serious shock, has to try and meet the challenges.

{:start="21"}
21.	You first have the three Budgets between 18 February and 6 April. Close to $60 billion committed, 12% of our GDP. Wide-ranging measures: job protection, immediate cash to Singaporeans, measures to help stabilise businesses, including Government-supported loans.

{:start="22"}
22.	Second, on the banking and finance side, MAS has worked with the banks. They announced a series of voluntary initiatives by the financial institutions: deferment of payments on mortgages; principal and interest: where borrower wants it, can be deferred; other measures, on credit flow to businesses as well.

{:start="23"}
23.	This Bill is the third part of the response by the Government.
