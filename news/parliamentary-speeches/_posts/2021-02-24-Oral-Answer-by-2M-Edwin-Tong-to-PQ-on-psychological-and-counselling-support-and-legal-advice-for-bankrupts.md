Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Member of Parliament for Ang Mo Kio GRC) 

<b><u>Question</u></b>

To ask the Minister for Law whether the Ministry will consider providing psychological and counselling support and legal advice for all bankrupts.

<b><u>Oral Answer</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	The bankruptcy regime aims to help bankrupts make a fresh start in their financial matters, whilst at the same time also ensuring that the rights of their creditors remain adequately protected. When a person is made a bankrupt, his or her estate will be administered by the Official Assignee or a Private Trustee appointed by the General Division of the High Court. 

{:start="2"}
2.	MinLawâ€™s Insolvency Office makes available to debtors and bankrupts user-friendly information on the bankruptcy process. The Insolvency Office does not provide direct psychological and counselling support or legal advice to bankrupts. However, it maintains a list of social service agencies and legal clinics so that it can make the necessary referrals where appropriate. If bankrupts require psychological and counselling support, the Official Assignee or the appointed Private Trustee will refer them to a suitable social service agency or a family service centre. If they require legal advice, they are referred to the Legal Aid Bureau or a suitable legal clinic in the community, depending on their profile and the subject matter on which they seek advice.
