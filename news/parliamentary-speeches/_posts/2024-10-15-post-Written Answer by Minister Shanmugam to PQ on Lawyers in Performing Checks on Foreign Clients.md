<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>Mr Yip Hon Weng (Member of Parliament for Yio Chu Kang SMC)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law with regard to the case of the
members of a Japanese money-laundering syndicate setting up companies in Singapore (a) what is the accountability of the lawyers who acted for such companies as Corporate Service Provider; and (b) whether the current verification process by lawyers to do background checks on clients will be reviewed.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	The Ministry of Law and the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority are looking into this matter.

{:start="2"}
2. There are anti-money laundering / countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) requirements that apply separately to both lawyers and corporate service providers (CSPs). Lawyers who act as CSPs are expected to fully comply with the AML/CFT requirements applicable to all CSPs. These include requirements to conduct customer due diligence, enhanced customer due diligence for higher risk customers, and to report suspicious transactions.

{:start="3"}
3. Singaporeâ€™s AML/CFT requirements on verification and background checks are reviewed to be consistent with applicable international standards.
