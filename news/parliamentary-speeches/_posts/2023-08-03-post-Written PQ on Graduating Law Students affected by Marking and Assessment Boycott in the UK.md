<b>Ms Hany Soh (Member of Parliament for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law in light of the marking and assessment boycott by the University and College Union in the UK that began on 20 April 2023 (a) whether applications for the Singapore Bar Examinations by graduating law students from the UK universities will be affected; and (b) how will the Ministry support these affected applicants.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning graduates from UK universities are required to submit documentation to the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE), which administers the admission regime, in order to ascertain their eligibility to take their next steps towards admission to the Singapore Bar, such as taking Part A of the Singapore Bar Examinations or commencing their relevant legal training.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This includes producing the relevant certification that a graduate has completed the degree programme in an approved school and met the necessary academic requirements.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Ministry is monitoring the situation closely in consultation with the SILE. In the event that graduating students seeking to do their Part A Examinations or embark on their relevant legal training are unable to produce the necessary certifications, SILE will consider administrative arrangements to assist on an exceptional basis. This includes looking into allowing the students affected by the boycott to proceed with their Part A Examinations or relevant legal training first, and then submitting their certifications subsequently.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who face issues in this regard can approach the SILE or the Ministry of Law for assistance.
