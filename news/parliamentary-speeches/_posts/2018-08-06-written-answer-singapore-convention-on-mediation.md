##### **Mr Christopher de Souza, Member of Parliament for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC**

### **Question**

To ask the Minister for Law (a) what is Singapore's contribution to the anticipated Singapore Convention on Mediation to be signed in August 2019; (b) how will the Convention be promoted; and (c) how is Singapore preparing the legal industry for it.


### **Written Answer:**

On 25 June 2018, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) at its 51st session in New York, decided to recommend to the 73rd United Nations General Assembly the following:

* first, to adopt a United Nations Convention on International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation;
* second, to authorise a signing ceremony for the Convention to be held as soon as practicable in 2019 in Singapore; and
* third, for the Convention to be known as the “Singapore Convention on Mediation”.

The Commission also adopted the Model Law on International Commercial Mediation and International Settlement Agreements Resulting from Mediation.
