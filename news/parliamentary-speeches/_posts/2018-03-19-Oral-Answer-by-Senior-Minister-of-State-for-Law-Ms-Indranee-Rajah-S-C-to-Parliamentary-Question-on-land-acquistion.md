**<u>Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament</u>**  
Mr Dennis Tan Lip Fong (Non-Constituency Member of Parliament)


**<u>Question</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law what measures are in place to minimise the time between when land is acquired by the Government and when that land is developed for the purpose for which it was acquired.

**<u>Oral Answer:</u>**

{:start="1"}
1. The Government carefully scrutinises all proposals for land acquisition. We weigh all available land options on their suitability to meet the requirements of a public development, before deciding on any land acquisition. 

 
{:start="2"}
2. Where private land is needed, the Ministry of Law and Singapore Land Authority work closely with the landowners and developing agencies to ensure that the acquired land can be handed over in time for development.  Affected landowners are given sufficient time to make alternative arrangements such as relocating to a replacement property.

 
{:start="3"}
3. The time taken for agencies to commence and complete development of acquired land parcels vary depending on the scale and complexity of the project.  Once the State takes possession of the acquired land, development works generally commence shortly after.
