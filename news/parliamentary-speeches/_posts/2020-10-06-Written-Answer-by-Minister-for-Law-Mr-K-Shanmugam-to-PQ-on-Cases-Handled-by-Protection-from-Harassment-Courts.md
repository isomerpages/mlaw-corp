Mr Leon Perera (Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC) 

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) since the Protection from Harassment Act was amended in 2019, what is the number of cases handled by the Protection from Harassment Courts; (b) what is the breakdown between applications for protection orders and expedited protection orders and the outcomes for these applications; and (c) what is the average time between the filing of the application and the application being heard. 


**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>**  

{:start="1"}
1. On 7 May 2019, amendments to the Protection from Harassment Act were passed by Parliament. The amendments enhance the existing protections given to victims of harassment. 

{:start="2"}
2.	From 8 May 2019 to 31 August 2020, the breakdown of applications for Protection Orders (“POs”) and Expedited Protection Orders (“EPOs”) is as follows. 

<b>Table 1: Outcomes of PO and EPO applications filed from 8 May 2019, as at 31 August 2020</b>

| **Type of Application** | **Applications Made** | **Applications Granted** |
|--|--|--|
|PO applications|207|79|
|EPO applications|167|108|

<b>Table 2: Breakdown of Outcomes of PO applications filed from 8 May 2019, as at 31 August 2020</b>

| **Outcomes** | **Number of Applications** |
|--|--|
|PO Applications Granted|79|
|PO Applications Not Granted|14|
|PO Applications Withdrawn|68|
|Pending PO Applications|46|

{:start="3"}
3. During this period, the average time for a PO application to be heard was 9 days from filing. The average time for an EPO application to be heard was 4 days from filing.

{:start="4"}
4. The amendments also provide for a new Protection from Harassment Courts (“PHC”), which will have oversight over all criminal and civil matters under POHA. 

{:start="5"}
5. The preparations for the PHC are in an advanced stage. The procedural rules and subsidiary legislation required to support the creation of the PHC are being drafted, and arrangements involving a few agencies are being put in place. Changes to several online court filing systems, including the introduction of a dedicated POHA module, are also being implemented. The Ministry will make an announcement when the PHC is ready.
