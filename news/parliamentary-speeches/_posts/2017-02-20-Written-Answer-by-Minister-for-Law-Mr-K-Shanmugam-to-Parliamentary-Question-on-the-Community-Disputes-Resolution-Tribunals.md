**Ms Tin Pei Ling (Member of Parliament for MacPherson SMC)**

**<u>Question</u>**

To ask the Minister for Law (a) over the past 12 months, how many community dispute applications have been received by the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals; (b) of these, how many have been (i) accepted by the tribunals (ii) successfully resolved and (iii) given orders for one of the parties to receive a mental health assessment.

**<u>Answer:</u>**


1. The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (“CDRT”) was established on 1 October 2015 as a forum to help neighbours with difficult disputes resolve their conflicts after avenues such as community mediation have been exhausted.


2. Between 1 Oct 2015 and 31 Jan 2017, the CDRT received 109 applications. Out of these 109 applications, 102 claims have been disposed of and 7 claims are pending. Out of the 102 claims that have been disposed of, a total of 73 claims were successfully resolved – 55 claims were withdrawn/discontinued and a Consent Order was granted in the other 18 claims. As for the remaining 29 claims, the CDRT granted orders after trial or dismissed/struck off the applications.


3. The Community Disputes Resolution Act 2015 does not provide the CDRT with the power to order a party to undergo a mental health assessment.  However, there are existing measures in place to facilitate the referral of parties who may be suffering from mental health issues for examination. The CDRT’s in-house psychologists and court counsellors will first conduct a preliminary assessment on the party’s suspected mental health issue. They will then provide inputs to the Judge on whether the party will benefit from a referral to the Institute of Mental Health for medical examination and treatment, and facilitate the referral.
