**Ms Ellen Lee, Sembawang GRC**

**<u>Question</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law up to September 2012, what is the number of non-landed properties sold with unanimous or majority consent under collective sale agreements (CSA), with a breakdown of the number of units indicating consent or dissent/no action of owner-occupied and investor-occupied units respectively and by ownership tenure of (i) less than 5 years (ii) between 5 and 10 years (iii) between 10 and 20 years (iv) 20 or more years, as at the date of first signature of the CSA.


**<u>Written Answer</u>**  
The voting rights of an owner in a collective sale depend on the size of his unit. In other respects the rights of all owners are the same, whether they are occupiers or investors, and regardless of the length of ownership. We therefore do not track the statistics sought by the Member.
