**Asst Prof Mahdev Mohan (Nominated Member of Parliament)**

**<u>Question:</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law in each year since 2011, how many instances have there been of cross-examination by defence counsel which have been calculated to scandalise and insult the moral integrity of complainants or witnesses in criminal trials concerning sexual or child abuse offences.  

**<u>Answer:</u>**
1. We do not have the specific numbers requested. However, our discussions with both the courts and the Bar indicate that while this is not yet a serious problem, such conduct does take place.
