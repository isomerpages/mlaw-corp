**I. Introduction**

{:start="1"}
1. Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a Second time.”

{:start="2"}
2. Singapore is internationally recognised for having a justice system that is fair, transparent, and effective. We have a world-class Judiciary that is known for its competence, independence, and utmost integrity.  

{:start="3"}
3. The sound justice system has brought about many tangible benefits to Singaporeans:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
   <li style="text-align: justify">The value of our legal industry, and jobs in the legal sector, have grown in tandem with our status as a legal hub.</li>
   <li style="text-align: justify">A reputation for being an efficient dispute resolution centre and respect for the rule of law have also enhanced Singapore’s attractiveness as an investment destination.</li>
</ol>
       
{:start="4"}
4. But we cannot afford to rest on our laurels. We have to constantly look ahead and improve on what we have to stay relevant and competitive. 

{:start="5"}
5. So, this Bill represents the latest of our continual efforts to improve our justice system. Let me now take Members through the key aspects of the Bill. 

**II. Digital transformation of the courts** 

{:start="6"}
6. First, I would like to touch on the digital transformation of the courts. As Members will appreciate, the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a reduction in the level of person-to-person contact.  

{:start="7"}
7. In April 2020, we introduced a temporary remote hearing framework under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act to maintain access to justice amidst safe distancing measures. These measures have brought convenience to court users, and also increased administrative efficiency.  

{:start="8"}
8. We are now looking to enact a permanent framework that will facilitate the use of technology in court proceedings.

<b>Live video-link hearings in civil and criminal proceedings</b>

{:start="9"}
9. Under the Bill, courts will be generally empowered to conduct hearings remotely, using appropriate electronic means such as video-link. For example, we may have hearings where only one party is physically present before the Judge, while the other party appears via video-link. We may also have hearings that take place entirely online. 

{:start="10"}
10. Regardless of the specific remote hearing arrangements, the court’s overriding duty in each case will be to ensure that proceedings are conducted fairly to all parties. There will also be statutory powers to exclude certain types of matters from being heard remotely, should this prove necessary.  

{:start="11"}
11. Where witness testimony is concerned, the courts have existing powers under the Evidence Act to allow witnesses to give evidence remotely in civil matters. 

{:start="12"}
12. The Bill will now amend the Evidence Act to enhance safeguards relating to remote testimony. For example, matters which the court must consider before it allows witnesses to give evidence remotely can be prescribed.  

{:start="13"}
13. For criminal matters, the courts already have existing powers under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to allow a witness to give evidence via live video-link, if the witness is in Singapore. The Bill seeks to expand this in two ways:  

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
   <li style="text-align: justify">First, the court may now allow an expert witness, or a witness of fact, to give evidence via video-link, even if the witness is not in Singapore. There will of course be appropriate safeguards for this. For example, in the case of a witness of fact, all parties – including the defence – must agree to the witness giving evidence from outside Singapore. Where parties do not agree, the witness will only be allowed to do so if he is unable to give evidence in Singapore, and has set out in writing the evidence which he proposes to give to the court. This provides advance notice to the other parties, so that the veracity of the witness’s evidence can be adequately investigated.</li>
   <li style="text-align: justify">Second, the court may allow an accused person to appear or give evidence via video-link from a stipulated location in Singapore, such as in court or from a prison. The court may also allow an accused person to appear or give evidence via video-link from another place in Singapore if all parties agree.</li>
</ol>

{:start="14"}
14. In both cases, the court must be satisfied that allowing the witness or the accused person to give evidence remotely will be in the interests of justice. The court must also be satisfied that there are sufficient administrative and technical arrangements in place, in order to facilitate the taking of evidence. For proceedings relating to contempt of court, a framework similar to that in the CPC will be introduced. 

<b>Documents-only hearings</b>

{:start="15"}
15. The Bill will also empower the courts to decide any matter based on written submissions and documents tendered by the parties, without any oral hearing. This is commonly known as a ‘paper hearing’. 

{:start="16"}
16. A paper hearing can improve efficiency in the conduct of administrative pre-trial matters, and can also save time and costs when it comes to the disposal of substantive matters that are document-centric. Appeals can also be heard on paper where appropriate. 

<b>Asynchronous hearings</b>

{:start="17"}
17. Next, let me touch on asynchronous hearings. The Bill will also make clear that parties can address the court and make their arguments via an “asynchronous” exchange in appropriate cases. 








{:start="18"}
18. Part 5 of the Bill deals with assessment and collection of the LBC, while Part 6 deals with the recovery of unpaid LBC. 

{:start="19"}
19. What is new is that SLA is empowered to issue a rectification order to collect penalty tax on top of the LBC due, where there has been:

    a. an illegal development of land, and URA regularises the development through a subsequent planning authorisation afterwards; or

    b. where there is an activity, development or subdivision carried out in breach of a restrictive covenant contained in a State title, and SLA assesses that it is not reasonably practicable or it is undesirable to stop or resume any controlled activity or to reinstate the land. To give Members an example of when this might happen, a developer may have subdivided the land and sold them to multiple buyers, and it would not be reasonably practicable or desirable in such a situation to order reinstatement.

    c. In that situation, the penalty tax is fixed at 30% of the LBC that is due. 

{:start="20"}
20. SLA is also given the discretion to impose a higher or lower penalty tax at a percentage fixed by the Bill:

    a. To increase the penalty tax if the taxpayer hinders or obstructs the determination of the taxpayer’s liability; or 

    b. to reduce the amount of penalty tax where the defaulting taxpayer is cooperative.

**Other provisions**

{:start="21"}
21. Finally, Sir, the Bill also includes other consequential amendments to the Planning Act to:

    a. abolish the collection of DC and TDL under that Act; and

    b. give the competent authority in URA and the Minister for National Development the discretion to refuse to grant an application for Written Permission, or refuse to accept a lodgment of any plans, if any LBC has not been paid in full.
