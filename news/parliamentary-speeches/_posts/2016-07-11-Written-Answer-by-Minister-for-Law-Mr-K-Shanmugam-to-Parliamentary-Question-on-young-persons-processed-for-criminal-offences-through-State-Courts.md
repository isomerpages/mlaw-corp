**Sylvia Lim, Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC**


**<u>Question:</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law (a) how many young persons aged between 16 and 18 years have been processed for criminal offences through the State Courts in the last three years; (b) which offence types have been most often charged against these young persons; and (c) what have been the most common types of sentences or orders made upon conviction of such persons.


**<u>Answer:</u>**  
1. Between 2013 and 2015, 2,254 young persons aged between 16 and 18 years have been charged for criminal offences in the State Courts.

2. The most common types of offences which these young persons have been charged with are the offences of theft and cheating under the Penal Code, and offences under the Moneylenders Act, Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act, and the Road Traffic Act.

3. While we continue to underscore the need to maintain law and order in our criminal justice system, we recognise the importance of rehabilitation as well for young offenders in appropriate cases. Between 2013 and 2015, 2,046 young persons aged between 16 and 18 years were convicted, of which close to half of these young persons were given Probation (or Probation and other types of sentences such as a fine), while about 30% were sentenced to a fine (or a sentence of fine and disqualification from holding or obtaining a driving licence under the Road Traffic Act) and about 15% were sentenced to Reformative Training (or Reformative Training and other types of sentences such as a fine).
