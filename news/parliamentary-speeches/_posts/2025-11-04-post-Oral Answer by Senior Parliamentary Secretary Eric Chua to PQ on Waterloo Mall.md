<b><u>Question for Oral Answer</u></b>

<b>Ms Denise Phua Lay Peng (Member of Parliament for Jalan Besar GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister of Law whether the Ministry can provide an update on the outcomes of the Singapore Land Authority’s coordination efforts to preserve orderliness of the Waterloo Mall especially outside the temple where illegal hawking is rife.

<b><u>Oral Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1. In 2020, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA), Singapore Food Agency (SFA), and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) carried out a street enhancement exercise at the pedestrianised Waterloo Mall. The objective was to improve public health and safety, as well as to enhance the streetscape. As part of this exercise, SLA issued Temporary Occupation Licences (TOLs) to existing street vendors to enable and require that they ply their trades within designated spaces.

2. From time to time, there are incidences of unlicensed street hawkers such as tissue paper vendors or individuals soliciting for donations in the area. To preserve orderliness, agencies regularly conduct joint operations, especially during peak periods, to enforce licensing conditions and maintain order in the area.

3. Agencies are mindful that the unlicensed street hawkers in the area are of a mixed profile. Some are elderly and some appear to have medical conditions. Some also may face more complex challenges such as social isolation. While these in any combination, may form their motivation for illegal hawking, it may not always be the case. For those who may be vulnerable, agencies work with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to refer them to the Vulnerable-In-Community (VIC) Network, comprising volunteer groups and government agencies. Those requiring assistance will be linked to relevant agencies, so that the root causes can be addressed.

4. These joint operations are supported by the Singapore Police Force (SPF), which maintains a balanced enforcement approach in the vicinity of the temples along Waterloo Street, that considers both community sensitivities and public safety needs. SPF will intervene as necessary when law-and-order issues arise.

5. The regular presence of government agencies has generally helped in maintaining order among the unlicensed street hawkers and other groups, and minimised incidents. The agencies will continue to monitor the situation closely.
