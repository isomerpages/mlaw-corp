<b>Assoc Prof Jamus Jerome Lim (Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law what is the respective application procedure for (i) tenants of black-and-white properties and (ii) owners of landed properties, who wish to independently maintain state land adjacent to their properties.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"} 
1. Tenants of heritage bungalows managed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) can contact SLA or the relevant managing agent, if they wish to submit a request to maintain vacant State land located adjacent to their property. Owners of private landed properties can similarly write to SLA. 

{:start="2"}
2. Such requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis, based on the specific circumstances. The factors that will be taken into consideration include, amongst others, the reasons for the request, what the tenant or owner intends to do with the State land, the specific site conditions and how SLAâ€™s interests would be best achieved given the circumstances.
