**Ms He Ting Ru (Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC)**

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law since the establishment of the Public Defender's Office (PDO) (a) how many applications have been received by the PDO; (b) how many applications have been rejected; and (c) what is the breakdown for the unsuccessful applications in terms of the applicants failing the (i) means or (ii) merits test.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	As of September 2023, the Public Defenderâ€™s Office has received around 1,300 applications, of which close to 580 were assessed as eligible for criminal defence aid under the Public Defenders Act.

{:start="2"}
2.	Out of about 420 rejected applications, about half did not satisfy the prescribed means criteria. Almost 30% were assessed to have a lack of merits. Other reasons for rejection include the applicant already being represented by a private lawyer or not yet charged in court.

{:start="3"}
3.	The remaining 300 applications are either ongoing, or closed due to reasons such as withdrawal or applicants not following up.
