**Assoc Prof Tan Kheng Boon Eugene, Nominated Member**

**<u>Question:</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law (a) whether a robust process is in place to ensure that the Singapore Statutes Online is updated in a timely manner; and (b) whether repealed legislation, past versions of current legislation, and past Government Gazettes can be made available on Singapore Statutes Online. 


**<u>Answer:</u>**    
1. The Singapore Statutes Online (SSO) is maintained in-house by a dedicated unit within the Attorney General’s Chambers. Generally speaking, new content is updated <u>within 3 working days</u>.

2. As for repealed legislation and past versions of current legislation, these are already available to subscribers of the LAWNET, which is a service provided by the Singapore Academy of Law.

3. Past Government Gazettes are also available on the eGazette website on subscription. There are contractual arrangements between the Government (MCI) and the Government Printer which entitle the Government Printer to charge a subscription as consideration for maintaining the eGazette website at their own cost.
