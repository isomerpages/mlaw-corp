**Ms Rahayu Mahzam (Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC)**

**<u>Question</u>**

To ask the Minister for Law since the inception of the Community Dispute Resolution Tribunal (CDRT) (a) what is the total number of cases that have been heard by CDRT and the breakdown for each year to-date; (b) what is the percentage of the total number of cases where an order on mandatory mediation is made; and (c) what is the total number of exclusion orders made. 

**<u>Written Answer</u>**

1. The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (CDRT) were established on 1 October 2015 as a forum to facilitate the resolution of disputes between neighbours after other avenues such as community mediation have been exhausted.
 
2. Between 1 October 2015 and 30 June 2019, the CDRT received a total of 324 applications. Out of these 324 applications, 294 cases have been disposed of, while 30 cases are still pending as at 30 June 2019.
 
3. The breakdown of cases received by the CDRT for each year to-date is as follows: 27 cases were received in 2015, 80 cases were received in 2016, 57 cases were received in 2017, and 108 cases were received in 2018. Between 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2019, 52 cases were received.
 
4. The CDRT has made a mandatory mediation order in 82 cases. This represents about 25% of the cases thus far.
 
5. To-date, the CDRT has not made any exclusion orders. Two applications for an exclusion order were received in 2018. However, in both cases, the CDRT declined to make the exclusion order.
