<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>Ms Joan Pereira (Member of Parliament for Tanjong Pagar GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) what assistance is available to help seniors who live alone and have no family members or friends to draw up and formalise their wills; and (b) how can these seniors be sure that their wills will be accessed and executed accordingly after their death.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	Members of the public are encouraged to make a Will, as it would allow them to decide how their assets should be distributed after they pass on.

{:start="2"}
2. Seniors who live alone can write their Will themselves or engage a third party to help them write one. They can also consult a lawyer, for example if their Will involves complicated arrangements. A senior needs to be of sound mind when making a Will.

{:start="3"}
3. After they have made a Will, seniors can deposit information on their Will with the Singapore Academy of Law Wills Registry (wills.sal.sg). This will facilitate access to the Will after they have passed on. 

{:start="4"}
4. Those who wish to write their Will themselves may refer to My Legacy@LifeSG (mylegacy.life.gov.sg), which is a one-stop Government platform that assists individuals with legacy planning and end-of-life matters. My Legacy provides step-by-step information on how to make and deposit information on their Will.

{:start="5"}
5. Seniors can also approach Pro Bono SGâ€™s Community Law Centres and Community Legal Clinics for legal advice and assistance with Wills. They can also obtain assistance from the Legal Aid Bureau to draft their Will and deposit information on the Will, if they pass the means test.
