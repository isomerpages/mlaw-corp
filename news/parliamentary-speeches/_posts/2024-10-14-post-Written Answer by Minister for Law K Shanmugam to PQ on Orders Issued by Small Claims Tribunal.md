<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Member of Parliament for Radin Mas SMC)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law for the past five years (a) what is the annual percentage of orders issued by the Small Claims Tribunals (SCT) that required enforcement; and (b) of these, what is the average cost for consumers to enforce the SCT order.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;The Ministry does not track the percentage of orders issued by the Small Claims Tribunals (SCT) that require enforcement.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;From 2019 to August 2024, there were about 880 applications for enforcement of an SCT order.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;The costs for enforcement are prescribed under the Rules of Court. We do not track the legal fees that consumers may incur in enforcing the SCT order – this is case specific, depends on the scope of work to be performed, and is a matter to be agreed between the consumer and his lawyer.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;Parties who require legal advice on the enforcement of SCT orders may approach the State Courts’ Community Justice Centre for free on-site legal advice, or seek assistance from other legal clinics, such as those organised by the Law Society Pro Bono Services, or community centres.
