<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>Mr Gerald Giam Yean Song (Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) what percentage of judgments delivered in the Small Claims Tribunals, Employment Claims Tribunal, and Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre are publicly accessible; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider establishing a searchable database of tribunal decisions and widely publicise its existence to enhance transparency in dispute resolution and access to justice for individual claimants.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	In general, the Executive leaves it to the Courts to decide on which
judgments to publish. The Courts have decided that judgments
delivered in the Small Claims Tribunals ("<b>SCT</b>") and Employment Claims Tribunals ("<b>ECT</b>") need not be published. The Courts’ position is that they may make judgments available to any individual, whether a party or a non-party to the SCT or ECT proceedings, upon request.

2. The Courts have explained that this approach strikes a balance between helping the public understand the law and how it is applied, ensuring that the tribunals continue to dispense justice in a timely manner, and maintaining the confidential nature of some proceedings.

{:start="3"}
3. The SCT and ECT have published guides to help the public understand the types of disputes adjudicated by the SCT and ECT, and to navigate court processes. The Courts have said that there are also efforts by them to leverage on advances in technology to help the public with their claims.

4. As mentioned previously in Parliament, MOM is reviewing the publication of ECT judgments. Further, the State Courts have indicated that they are also considering the feasibility of publishing selected SCT and ECT judgments on an anonymised basis, without a prior request being made.

{:start="5"}
5. The Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre ("<b>FIDReC</b>") is an independent alternative dispute resolution centre that seeks to promote amicable and fair outcomes in disputes between consumers and financial institutions. FIDReC is neither part of the Government nor the Judiciary. We understand that FIDReC adjudication decisions are not published as its processes are confidential and conducted without prejudice. Instead, FIDReC publishes case studies and annual reports on their website that include learning points for the public. We have conveyed the Member’s feedback to FIDReC.
