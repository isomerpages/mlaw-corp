***2386 Mr Sitoh Yih Pin:** To ask the Minister for Law (a) what is the number of foreign domestic workers who have procured loans from licensed moneylenders in 2017 and 2018; (b) what are the liabilities for employers of foreign domestic workers who default on repayment of such loans; and (c) whether the Ministry has any plans to place any restrictions on foreign domestic workers procuring such loans.


**<u>Oral Answer</u>**

1. Mr Darryl David and Mr Sitoh Yih Pin asked about the consequences for foreign domestic workers (FDWs) and employers, and the recourse for employers when FDWs borrow from licensed and unlicensed moneylenders.  I will address these questions together.
 
2. Where licensed moneylending is concerned, FDWs who do not repay their loans may be subject to civil action by licensed moneylenders, as with any other borrowers. Employers of FDWs are not liable to repay any of their FDWs’ loans. It is an offence for licensed moneylenders to harass the FDWs or their employers for repayment, or employ an agent to do so. FDW employers who are harassed should report to the Police.
 
3. We do not condone any borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders by foreign workers. To send a clear signal of our strong stand, the Ministry of Manpower had earlier announced that if a work pass holder is found to have borrowed from unlicensed moneylenders, the employer will be informed and the employee’s work pass revoked. The foreign worker will then be repatriated and debarred from further employment in Singapore.
 
4. The rule against borrowing from unlicensed moneylenders will be implemented in 2019, following a period of education and communication with work pass holders and their employers. We will intensify efforts to help them learn about money management and the risks of borrowing from moneylenders.
 
5. Any person who is harassed by unlicensed moneylenders should report such activities to the Police.  From 2008 to September 2018, the Police registered about 460 reports of harassment by unlicensed moneylenders arising from FDWs borrowing or acting as guarantors. The Police and Attorney-General’s Chambers have prosecuted errant debt collectors who have violated the law, and will continue to take strong enforcement action against such conduct.
