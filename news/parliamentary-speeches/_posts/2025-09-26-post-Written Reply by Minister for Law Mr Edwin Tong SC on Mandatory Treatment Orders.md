<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

**Dr Hamid Razak (Member of Parliament for West Coast-Jurong West GRC)**

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) how many individuals involved in severe hoarding cases have been issued (i) mandatory treatment orders and (ii) compliance bonds requiring psychiatric treatment since the Community Disputes Resolution (Amendment) Act 2024 came into operation on 24 March 2025; and (b) what proportion have complied with these orders.

**<u>Written Answer:</u>**

{:start="1"}
1.	The Mandatory Treatment Order framework under the Community Disputes Resolution (Amendment) Act 2024 has not come into operation. Cases where there are mental health conditions need to be managed carefully and sensitively. The Government is working through the details to ensure that the framework, when operationalised, is effective and robust.
