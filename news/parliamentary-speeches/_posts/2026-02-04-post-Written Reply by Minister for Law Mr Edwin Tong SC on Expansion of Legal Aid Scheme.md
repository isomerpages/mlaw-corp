1.&nbsp;The Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) and the Public Defender’s Office (PDO) provide legal aid to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, including those with special needs, who satisfy the means and merits tests.

2.&nbsp;Applicants with special needs who do not meet the means test criteria, but have extenuating circumstances will also have their applications reviewed by an independent Means Test Panel for possible support.

3.&nbsp;Pro Bono SG (PBSG) provides legal assistance at their Community Law Centres and various legal clinics across Singapore. They run schemes such as the Ad Hoc Pro Bono Scheme, which accepts referrals for needy or vulnerable individuals who do not qualify for other legal aid schemes but require legal help due to exceptional circumstances.
