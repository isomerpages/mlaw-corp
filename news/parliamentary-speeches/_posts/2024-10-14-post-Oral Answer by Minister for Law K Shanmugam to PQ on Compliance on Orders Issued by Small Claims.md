<b><u>Question for Oral Answer</u></b>

<b>Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye (Member of Parliament for Radin Mas SMC)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law since 1 April 2022 (a) what is the number of orders issued by the Small Claims Tribunals; (b) whether the Ministry tracks the compliance of these orders; (c) whether the Ministry is aware of cases where either party fails to execute or enforce the order due to a lack of resources to hire a lawyer; and (d) if so, what is the percentage of such cases.

<b><u>Oral Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;From 1 April 2022 to 31 July 2024, the Small Claims Tribunals (SCT) issued about 10,750 money orders and work orders.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;The Ministry does not track compliance with SCT orders nor the reasons that a party fails to execute or enforce an order.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;Parties who require legal advice on the enforcement of SCT orders may approach the State Courtsâ€™ Community Justice Centre for free on-site legal advice, or seek assistance from other legal clinics, such as those organised by the Law Society Pro Bono Services, or community centres.
