Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Member of Parliament) 

**<b><u>Question</u></b>**  
To ask the Minister for Law for each year of the past five years (a) what is the number of court applications involving a spouse who refuses to comply with court orders pertaining to the sale of the matrimonial home; (b) for these applications, what is the average and mean duration of the application from the date of the initial order requiring the sale of the matrimonial home; (c) what is the average and mean number of previous applications also involving such non-compliance by the spouse; and (d) if such data is not currently collected, whether the Ministry will consider collecting such data.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>**  

1. Currently, the data referred to in (a), (b), and (c) are not collected.

2. In relation to (b), the time between the making of the initial order and the enforcement or variation of that order depends on the facts of the case, including the terms of the initial order, the circumstances of that case, and when the party concerned decides to make the application.  

3. We will explore with the Courts if they are able to collect such data.
