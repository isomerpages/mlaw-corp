<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b><br>
<b>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (Member of Parliament for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b><br>
To ask the Minister for Law (a) what number and percentage of discharged bankrupts between (i) 2010 and 2015, (ii) 2016 and 2020 and (iii) 2020 and 2025 paid their Target Contributions in full prior to discharge; (b) among these bankrupts, what is the average and median time spent in bankruptcy over those time periods; and (c) whether the formula to calculate Target Contributions is adequate.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b><br>

1.&nbsp;As the concept of target contribution was introduced in August 2016 as part of the Differentiated Discharge Framework (“<b>DDF</b>”), the figures provided relate only to cases that come under the DDF.

  <tbody><tr>
    <th scope="row"><b>Year of discharge</b></th>

    <td><b>2021 - 2025 Sep</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row"><b>No. of discharged DDF cases that met target contribution</b></th>
    <td>1,881</td>
    <td>68</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <th scope="row"><b>Proportion of discharged DDF cases that met target contribution</b></th>
    <td>97%</td>
    <td>88%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th scope="row"><b>Mean duration in bankruptcy of discharged DDF cases that met target contribution</b></th>
    <td>6 years</td>
    <td>4 years</td>
  </tr>
	  <tr>
    <th scope="row"><b>Median duration in bankruptcy of discharged DDF cases that met target contribution</b></th>
    <td>5 years</td>
    <td>4 years</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

2.&nbsp;The target contribution is fixed as a multiple of the monthly contribution, being either 52 months of monthly contribution for first-time bankrupts or 76 months of monthly contribution for repeat bankrupts. The monthly contribution is in turn determined in accordance with statutory criteria that take into account the bankrupt’s income or earning ability, and allowances for reasonable expenses. The Ministry of Law regularly reviews the bankruptcy regime to balance the interests of debtors and creditors.
