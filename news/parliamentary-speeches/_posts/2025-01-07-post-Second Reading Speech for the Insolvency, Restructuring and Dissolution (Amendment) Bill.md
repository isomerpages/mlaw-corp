{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move, “That the Bill be now read a Second time.”

<b><u>I. INTRODUCTION</u></b>

<b>(A) Rationale for the current Simplified Insolvency Programme</b>

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;Sir, as the House may recall, the current Simplified Insolvency Programme (“<b>SIP</b>”), was first introduced in 2021 as a temporary measure as part of the larger package of measures to support companies during the pandemic. The SIP has since been extended thrice, and will end on 28 January 2026.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;The SIP assisted eligible micro and small companies (“<b>MSCs</b>”) facing financial difficulties by helping them restructure their debts, rehabilitate their business or wind up via a simpler, faster and lower cost insolvency process.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	The SIP was scoped to assist MSCs because MSCs form a significant proportion of the enterprise eco-system in Singapore and are really the lifeblood of our economy and of our communities. </p>
	
<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	In 2022, for instance, small enterprises accounted for about 94% of Singapore’s enterprise landscape.</p>

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;The purpose, therefore, underpinning the SIP was thus to provide a simplified process that was tailor-made for MSCs that is simpler, faster and more cost-effective.

<p><b>(B) Successes of current SIP</b></p>

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;We have found in the time that we have introduced the SIP, that it was by and large useful in assisting MSCs in severe financial distress.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(a)	To give members some indication of the numbers, as at 31 December 2024, a total of 116 applications for the existing SIP had been submitted, and 77 of them were accepted. Of these, 61 MSCs in severe financial distress were successfully assisted. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(b)	For simplified winding up, the completion of cases was done within an average of nine months, and some as quickly as a few months. This compares very favourably to a typical process, which could take anywhere between three to four years, especially where there is a longer tail of transactions and contracts to resolve.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(c)	This shorter process allowed non-viable companies to be liquidated quickly. The expedited process saves time and costs, and lessens the impact on the principals behind the business while preserving the value of the insolvency estate for distribution to creditors.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(d) For simplified debt restructuring, there are fewer cases compared to simplified winding up. A successful case was the restructuring of the Axis Group Asia Private Limited. This was done with court sanction in under six months, which was a very short period of time.</p>

<b><u>II. OBJECTIVE OF THE BILL</u></b>

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;With the success of the SIP, this Bill now seeks to introduce a refined SIP – one which I shall call the SIP 2.0 – to make it a permanent feature of our corporate debt restructuring and insolvency regime in the Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 (“<b>IRDA</b>”).

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	As there was merit in making the SIP permanent as part of the insolvency and restructuring ecosystem, we explored further over the course of the last couple of months how the current SIP could be suitably modified to allow companies that are not MSCs to also benefit from it. </p>

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;We consulted with public agencies and stakeholders from the private sector, and the industry was generally supportive of having the SIP as a permanent programme and provided helpful feedback for us to refine the framework. We have taken this on board where possible to improve the current SIP.

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;SIP 2.0 seeks to provide a simpler and more cost-effective insolvency process, to benefit more companies.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;The Bill will therefore modify two existing processes under the SIP, namely the Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (“<b>SDRP</b>”) and the Simplified Winding Up Programme (“<b>SWUP</b>”). 

{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp;Unlike the current SIP, the processes in SIP 2.0 will be fully administered by licensed insolvency practitioners in the private sector who are experienced and have the relevant expertise.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(a)	This approach, Members may know, is consistent with other corporate insolvency processes, such as Court-ordered winding up and creditors’ voluntary winding up, which are administered by private liquidators who are also licensed insolvency practitioners.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(b)	Members will also recall how our companies winding up regime became fully administered by private liquidators when the IRDA came into force in July 2020.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(c)	The approach for the SIP is thus consistent with existing debt restructuring and insolvency processes where the private sector currently already takes the lead.</p>

{:start="11"}
11.&nbsp;With that, Mr Speaker, let me take Members through the key changes to the SIP which this Bill proposes to implement.

<b><u>III. KEY CHANGES TO THE SIP</u></b>

{:start="12"}
12.&nbsp;Let me start with the changes relating to the eligibility criteria for the two programmes under the SIP, before explaining the key changes to each of the programmes. So the eligibility criteria apply to both the SDRP as well as the SWUP. 

<b>(A) Simpler eligibility criteria</b>

{:start="13"}
13.&nbsp;Under Clauses 7 and 32 of the Bill, which amend sections 72F(2) and 250F(2) of the IRDA, the current list of five criteria will be streamlined to just one, which is the general eligibility requirement that the company’s total liabilities must not exceed $2 million.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(a)	This will make it much easier for companies that are not MSCs to also benefit from the SIP. </p>

<b>(B) Simplified Debt Restructuring Programme (SDRP)</b>

{:start="14"}
14.&nbsp;Under the SDRP, a company will draw up a debt restructuring proposal for its creditors, which provides for a compromise or otherwise an arrangement to resolve its debts.

{:start="15"}
15.&nbsp;The Bill will modify the existing SDRP in several key aspects.

{:start="16"}
16.&nbsp;To begin with, we will reduce the number of supporting documents accompanying the SDRP application to require only key supporting documents.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(a)	A Restructuring Adviser, who is a licensed insolvency practitioner appointed by the company to advise the company in matters relating to its entry into the SDRP will assess whether the company reaches or matches the requirements for the SDRP, and request for further documents from the company if necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(b)  This simplifies the entry process.</p>

{:start="17"}
17.&nbsp;Companies failing to successfully complete the SDRP (including the current SDRP) will be barred for five years before they can again apply for the SDRP. This serves to protect the interests of creditors, and also prevents errant companies from abusing the SDRP by making repeated entry applications to avoid its obligations to creditors.

{:start="18"}
18.&nbsp;Under Clause 6, the Restructuring Adviser has the discretion to assess whether the company meets both the requirements under section 72F(1) for entry into the SDRP. This refers to the general eligibility criterion that the company’s total liabilities must not exceed $2 million and that there is no circumstance in existence that would render the company unsuitable for acceptance into the SDRP.

{:start="19"}
19.&nbsp;To give members some colour into the second criterion, one such circumstance is prescribed in the amended section 72F(3)(h), which is when the company is unlikely to be able to formulate a proposed compromise with its creditors, or to obtain the agreement of two thirds majority (by value) of its creditors to the proposed compromise or arrangement, within the moratorium period after the company’s entry into the SDRP.

{:start="20"}
20.&nbsp;While the company is in the SDRP the company enjoys a statutory moratorium under the amended section 72K(1) of a period of 30 days, which is extendable once for a period of up to 30 days. So you get 30 plus 30 – a maximum of 60 days for a moratorium within which to frame the restructuring proposal.

{:start="21"}
21.&nbsp;This, Sir, balances the interests of the various stakeholders by providing reasonable breathing room to the company to propose a debt restructuring plan, whilst at the same time protecting the interests of the creditors. Members will know that during the moratorium period, there will be no enforcement against the corporate entity.

{:start="22"}
22.&nbsp;Once the company has entered into the SDRP, its Restructuring Adviser will provide assistance in drawing up the debt restructuring proposal to its creditors. 

{:start="23"}
23.&nbsp;Unlike the current programme where the proposal requires Court sanction, Clause 16 of the Bill provides that the proposal will be approved out-of-court and by the company’s creditors at a meeting summoned by the Restructuring Adviser under the new section 72M.

{:start="24"}
24.&nbsp;The notice to summon the meeting must contain such information as is set out in section 72M(3) and I will just quickly summarise what they are.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	It must include —</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">-	the details of the proposal;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">-	a statement of the effects of the proposal on creditors’ rights;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">-	a comparison of what the creditors will receive in the proposal and the most likely scenario if the compromise or arrangement pursuant to the proposal does not become binding on the company and its creditors; and</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">-	it must also contain information on the Restructuring Adviser’s remuneration.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	This notice must be given to every creditor of the company.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	In practice, as Members would know how such restructurings take place, the Restructuring Adviser would have engaged in informal discussions and talks with the creditors prior to the meeting, and depending on the outcome of these discussions, the Restructuring Adviser would by then already have a keen sense of how the creditors would expect to receive the proposal, and whether any changes might need to be made, while the creditors would also have heard about the proposal’s terms before formally receiving the notice.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	Nevertheless, we believe that this is essential as the notice is a formal measure to provide substantive fairness to all creditors so that they are apprised of the terms of the proposal, and know ahead of the meeting what they are going in for prior to the meeting.</p>

{:start="25"}
25.&nbsp;The proposal is approved by a majority of at least two-thirds in value of creditors present and voting at the meeting. This threshold remains unchanged from the existing programme.

{:start="26"}
26.&nbsp;There will be one voting class consisting of all unsecured creditors, ordinary and preferential (if applicable).

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	Secured creditors will only be bound by the proposal if the value of the security interest is less than the value of the secured creditor’s admissible debts or claims, only to the extent of the difference between the values, and that means the undersecured portion. In other words, for Members’ clarity, the difference between the value of the security for a secured creditor and the unsecured portion. So the differential is the only portion that will apply; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	Secured creditors will also be bound by the proposal if the value of the secured interest is equal to or more than the value of the secured creditor’s admissible debts or claims — but only to the extent that the creditor consents to be bound. So in some cases, the creditor might well have sufficient security, but might decide that the restructuring proposal makes sense and wants to participate and take part, in which case, the creditor can support the restructuring arrangement.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	This means, therefore, that a secured creditor is free to realise or deal with his security interest unless he has voted in favour of the proposal and consented to be bound, and the proposal’s terms prevent him from realising or otherwise dealing with his security interest.</p>

{:start="27"}
27.&nbsp;Sir, there are judicial safeguards for creditors with legitimate concerns arising from the approved proposal.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">•	A creditor who is bound by the proposal can apply to Court to object to the proposal on specified grounds under section 72N(3), where —</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px">-	there is a material procedural irregularity in relation to the meeting of the company and its creditors to approve the proposal or in relation to the approval of the creditors at the meeting;</p>

{:start="28"}
28.&nbsp;To deter such behaviour, Clause 2(d) of the Bill provides that persons who cause or abet egregious abuse of our court process as provided for under the new section 3(1)(da) and (db) will also be liable for contempt.

<p style="margin-left: 40px"><b><u>(C) Proposals have been carefully scoped</u></b></p>

{:start="29"}
29.&nbsp;In developing these proposals, we are keenly aware of the need to strike a balance between the need to guard against abuse of process and the rights of litigants to ventilate genuine claims before the courts.&nbsp;

{:start="30"}
30.&nbsp;Our policy intent is that the litigants and lawyers who act with reasonable care and in good faith should not be penalised.

{:start="31"}
31.&nbsp;We looked at past examples of conduct which amounted to abuse of process. We also examined the leading case of <i>Chee Siok Chin v MHA</i>,where the court had set out the categories of abuse of process at common law. To ensure that we only capture egregious cases as contempt, the provisions in the Bill specify narrower categories than what was set out in <i>Chee Siok Chin</i>.

{:start="32"}
32.&nbsp;The approach we have taken ensures that the amendments will not cover the typical case of a civil matter that is struck out for the sole reason that it has no merit. Such cases can continue to be adequately dealt with by striking out and costs orders.

{:start="33"}
33.&nbsp;The court will be able to examine the circumstances of the case, when considering whether the conduct constitutes contempt.

{:start="34"}
34.&nbsp;In scoping the proposals, we spoke to key stakeholders, including the Judiciary, to ensure that we have achieved the right balance.

{:start="35"}
35.&nbsp;We also spoke to members of the Bar on these amendments. There is consensus that lawyers must be held to high standards. At the same time, some members of the Bar have expressed concern whether these amendments may discourage lawyers from taking up difficult cases and arguments, where the merits of the case or the evidence may be borderline or unclear. They ask whether the amendments will prevent them from robustly representing the interests of their clients.

{:start="36"}
36.&nbsp;Let me make a few points to directly address these concerns.

{:start="37"}
37.&nbsp;First, I reiterate that the amendments are clarificatory in nature and do not lower the current threshold for contempt of court.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(a) The elements of the new provisions, particularly the mental element that the person must have “known or ought to have known” that the proceeding would amount to contempt, are consistent with the current section 3(1)(e) of the AOJPA.</p>
  
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(b) The new provisions are also consistent with the pre-AOJPA case law on other forms of contempt of court under which it was not necessary to prove an intention to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.</p>
  
<p style="margin-left: 40px">(c) The new provisions do not affect the procedural protections under the existing AOJPA. The standard of proof remains that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt under section 28 of the AOJPA. Consent of the Attorney-General is also required under section 30 of the AOJPA before contempt proceedings are instituted.</p>

{:start="38"}
38.&nbsp;Second, lawyers and litigants are already held to high standards. To re-iterate, those who exercise reasonable care and act in good faith will not be caught and have nothing to fear.

{:start="39"}
39.&nbsp;Let me illustrate this with an example:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(a) An accused person who has been convicted and had his appeal dismissed approaches a lawyer, shortly before the accused is to start serving his sentence. The accused presents new evidence that the lawyer is unsure whether is genuine. The lawyer needs more time to investigate the matter and makes an urgent court application so that the accused does not have to immediately start serving sentence. Eventually, after due investigation, it transpires that the allegedly new evidence is not genuine and the application is duly withdrawn.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(b) In such a circumstance, if the lawyer had acted in good faith and had taken reasonable steps before filing the court application, considering the limited time available to him, the lawyer will not be caught by the elements of the proposed amendments.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(c) This is because the standard of what the lawyer knew or ought to have known is contextual, and the court will have to examine carefully the factual matrix of each case. The standard also allows the court to take into account the practical challenges faced by lawyers.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(d) However, in the same scenario, if the lawyer had failed to take reasonable steps – for example, by ignoring obvious red flags, or had carried on conducting the application even after discovering that the new evidence was fabricated – then he may well be caught by the amendments. Rightly so, as we expect high standards from lawyers who owe paramount duties as officers of the court. Again, much will depend on the particular context of each case.</p>

{:start="40"}
40.&nbsp;This is why I say that lawyers and litigants who act with reasonable care and in good faith have nothing to fear.

{:start="41"}
41.&nbsp;On this point, as Honourable Members sitting in this House, we are ultimately concerned with the public good and must act in the best interest of all Singaporeans. As I mentioned at the start of my speech, our justice system is a key pillar of what has made our country successful. It is precious and must be protected.

{:start="42"}
42.&nbsp;All of us – the courts, lawyers, lawmakers and members of the public – have an interest in ensuring that we have an effective justice system that is focused on enforcing our laws and resolving genuine disputes. We also have a duty to ensure that our processes are not weaponised or abused.

<b><u>III. CONCLUSION</u></b>

{:start="43"}
43.&nbsp;The proposed amendments will help us deter egregious cases of abuse of process, and safeguard our justice system so that it continues to benefit and serve all of us.

{:start="44"}
44.&nbsp;As I have elaborated in some detail in going through the amendments, they are clarificatory, and are not intended to lower the threshold for contempt. I have also taken some time to explain the rationale behind the amendments.

{:start="45"}
45.&nbsp;So, while Honourable Members may have brought prepared speeches, I would ask that you may want to consider the explanations that I have already given, so that the response that I may provide later can be more efficient.

{:start="46"}
46.&nbsp;Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Law, I beg to move.
