<b>Mr Louis Ng Kok Kwang (Nee Soon GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry tracks the number of cases in the past five years involving disputes between neighbours over secondhand smoke where a party has sought to enforce a Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals order by (i) applying for a special direction (ii) applying for a person to enter into a compliance bond or (iii) applying for an exclusion order; and (b) for each of these applications, how many and what percentage of applicants have been successful in each year. 

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp; The Community Disputes Resolution Tribunals (“CDRT”) recorded 79 cases of “causing excessive smoke” from 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2023. This covers second-hand smoke and other smoke-related activities. The CDRT does not track second-hand smoke cases specifically.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp; Out of these 79 cases, as at 30 June 2023: (a) 31 CDRT orders were made; (b) 37 cases were withdrawn; (c) seven cases were dismissed; and (d) four cases are on-going.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp; From the 31 CDRT Orders that were made, seven applications for a Special Direction were filed. The CDRT granted the Special Direction in two cases.

{:start="4"}
4. Out of the two Special Direction applications that succeeded: (a) a Compliance Bond was concurrently sought and granted in 1 application; and (b) a subsequent application which was filed for an Exclusion Order was withdrawn.
