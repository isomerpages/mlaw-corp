<b>Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member of Parliament)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law since 2013, what are the sizes of the state land cleared in other instances of land clearance around state-owned black-and-white bungalows for safety or health reasons.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp; From time to time, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) receives feedback, from the tenants of residential State properties it manages and/or other residents in the vicinity, on issues related to vegetated land located within and adjacent to the properties.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp; SLA’s approach to such cases, including whether site clearance is necessary, is to assess each case on its merits, depending on the specific circumstances, and always with a view to safeguarding SLA’s interests as the landlord.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp; SLA will take into consideration, amongst other factors, the nature of the tenants’ public health and safety concerns, the specific tenancy details and how SLA’s interests would be best achieved in the context of the tenancy and its surrounding circumstances. The solution to the issues may also be site-specific. For example, some cases involving mosquito breeding can be resolved through more frequent fogging. However, site clearance may be carried out if the disamenity persists and it is necessary to address public health and safety concerns.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp; The considerations behind the site clearance for the cases at 26 Ridout Road and the State property at Dalvey Estate were explained in Parliament on 3 July 2023; these considerations did not include the size of the land to be cleared.
