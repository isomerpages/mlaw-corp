<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>**Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member of Parliament)**</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br> To ask the Minister for Law (a) whether the Singapore Land Authority has renewed the tenancy agreements for 26 and 31 Ridout Road in 2024; and (b) if so, what are the terms of the renewal and how do the rental rates compare with other black-and-white bungalow rental transactions in the Ridout Road estate in 2024.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) does not typically make public information on the renewal of tenancies for specific residential State properties. Most tenants will consider this private information. Nonetheless, given that 26 Ridout Road and 31 Ridout Road are currently occupied by Minister K Shanmugam and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan respectively, and there has been public interest in the matter, relevant information on the renewal of the tenancies of the two properties are set out below.

2.	26 Ridout Road is subject to a Tenancy Agreement of 3+3+3 years commencing in June 2018<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>. In line with SLA’s prevailing guidelines, the tenancy was renewed for a third three-year term commencing in June 2024, with an increased rental that was assessed by SLA’s professional valuers based on prevailing market rates. The renewal rental rate, on a per unit floor area basis, falls within the range for renewal transactions for other heritage bungalows in the Ridout Road estate from third quarter 2023 to second quarter 2024.

{:start="3"}
3.	31 Ridout Road is subject to a Tenancy Agreement of 3+3+2 years commencing in October 2019. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> The second three-year term commenced in October 2022 and has yet to be completed.
