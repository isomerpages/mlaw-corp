<ol>
<li style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">INTRODUCTION</li>  
</ol>

1. Thank you Chairman. Thank you members for the various speeches, that were made last week and also for the various suggestions that we canvassed.

<ol start="2">
<li>The Ministry of Law’s focus is two-fold –

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> First, we continually update the legal framework to meet the people’s needs as well as the businesses, all of those who call Singapore home. Fundamentally, our rule of law must remain strong, our legal framework must have laws that are relevant and also updated.</li>
<li> Second, we are strengthening Singapore’s position as the premier legal services hub for Asia, and beyond.

<ul>
<li>This also supports and contributes to the continuing transformation of Singapore’s economy.</li>
<li>We must continue to have a trusted system. I will touch on these themes, as follows:</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>  Theme 1: Maintaining trust in our legal system – serving the needs of all who live, work and play, in Singapore</li>  
</ol>

{:start="3"}
3. I will begin by giving an update on my Ministry’s efforts to continually update the legal framework to meet evolving needs. Mr Christopher De Souza touched on this.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold; color:#900">
<li>Criminal Justice.</li>
</ol>

{:start="4"}
4. On criminal justice, we passed extensive amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code and Evidence Act last year. We have since implemented most of the measures.

{:start="5"}
5. My Ministry also worked closely with the Ministry of Home Affairs on wide-ranging amendments to the Penal Code and other substantive criminal laws, that were introduced in Parliament earlier this year.

{:start="6"}
6. A major focus of these amendments is to enhance legal protections for vulnerable victims of crime, and ensure that our criminal justice framework addresses new forms of crime effectively.


<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Family justice.</li>
</ol>

{:start="7"}
7. As for family justice, we set up a committee with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Family Justice Courts last year, to build on the wide-ranging changes made in 2014. Its report will be released soon. We will consider the committee’s recommendations thereafter.

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Civil Justice – Court procedure and enforcement</li>
</ol>

{:start="8"}
8. Moving on to civil justice, we amended the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (SCJA) in October 2018 to enhance efficiency in court procedures and allow the courts to better manage proceedings.


<ol start="9">
<li>  That same month, two Committees, one convened by my Ministry and another by the Judiciary, proposed a number of changes to enhance the efficiency and affordability of our courts.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The public consultation on these proposals concluded on 31 January 2019. </li>
<li>We are reviewing the feedback and will make the necessary legislative amendments this year. </li>
<li>We will also work on legislation this year to strengthen the enforcement of civil orders. </li>
<li>These proposals work together and they also overlap with each other to ensure that our court processes continue to provide effective access to justice and that must remain the hallmark of our judicial system . </li> 
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="10"}
10. Mr Sitoh asked about promoting the use of mediation for commercial disputes. First, I am encouraged to hear about his story, and also his very positive experience with the mediation centre. This vindicates the efforts of our mediation community, to enhance mediation as an effective, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) tool. 

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>  Litigants are currently encouraged to attempt an amicable resolution of their disputes through alternative dispute resolution (ADR). This can include mediation, neutral evaluation or even attempting to negotiate settlements privately. </li>
<li>   Two of the changes proposed by the Committees relate to ADR:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, making it mandatory for parties to attempt to resolve their disputes before resorting to litigation; and</li>
<li>Secondly, empowering the court to order parties to attend ADR if the court is of the view that parties failed to reasonably consider ADR to resolve their dispute. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
 We recognise that ADR mechanisms such as mediation can be a valuable tool in resolving disputes or providing a forum for parties to ventilate key issues. We will decide how best to encourage the use of ADR after considering feedback on these proposals .
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Civil Justice – Community justice.</li>
</ol>

{:start="11"}
11. Moving on to the area of community justice, Mr Patrick Tay asked about cases filed under the Protection from Harassment Act.

{:start="12"}
12. As at 31 Dec 2018, 535 applications for Protection Orders have been filed.  Of these, 213 Protection Orders and 193 Expedited Protection Orders were granted. This includes applications by victims of workplace harassment.  99 applications for Protection Orders were referred to the State Courts Centre for Dispute Resolution.  Of the 96 cases that completed mediation, 59 reached a settlement leading to a withdrawal of the application or the grant of a Consent Protection Order.

{:start="13"}
13. Over the same period, 12 civil proceedings for statutory damages have been brought under section 11 of POHA, while 11 applications for non-publication orders under section 15 of POHA have been filed.  

{:start="14"}
14. 3,089 Magistrate’s Complaints have been filed for alleged POHA offences, while 51 Magistrate’s Complaints have been filed for alleged breaches of Protection Orders or Expedited Protection Orders. About 3 out of 10 Magistrate Complaints, inclusive of those related to POHA, underwent mediation – about 80% of these cases reached a settlement. 1,714 criminal cases with POHA charges have also been commenced by the Attorney-General’s Chambers.

{:start="15"}
15. We have taken note of Mr Tay’s suggestion to track the types of cases filed, and will work with the State Courts to explore this further.

{:start="16"}
16. As for the reporting and publication of POHA cases, any person may request for a copy of the court’s decision. The court may consider factors such as whether the applicant has a sufficient interest in the action or any other legitimate reason for making the request, in assessing such requests.

{:start="17"}
17. In every POHA case, oral grounds of decision are provided to explain the court’s reasons for its decision.  As in all cases in the State Courts, full written grounds will be published if there is an appeal to the High Court on the matter.

{:start="18"}
18. Mr Murali Pillai asked for an update on our review of the probate and administration regime. This review is taking place against the backdrop of a whole of government effort to improve the experience of citizens and their loved ones at the end-of-life.

{:start="19"}
19. My Ministry is therefore working with the Ministry of Health, GovTech and several other government agencies to develop a Moments of Life Digital Portal, to support Singaporeans as they deal with their estate management matters, or that of their loved ones, in the end-of-life journey.

{:start="20"}
20. Features will include step-by-step guidance on making wills and settling post-death estate matters. A beta version will be released by the end of 2019.

{:start="21"}
21. On top of that, we are also considering ways in which we can simplify estate administration; the process, how the process is for affected families, particularly where smaller estates are concerned. So, we are making the process simpler, more straightforward, less expensive for the smaller, simpler cases. But at the same time, also going upstream to help with the estate management and planning prior to that stage.


<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li> Access to justice.</li>
</ol>

{:start="22"}
22. Mr de Souza and Mdm Rahayu asked about legal aid.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We recently amended the Legal Aid and Advice Act to simplify the means test, provide greater flexibility to grant aid, and improve the administration of legal aid. These changes will be implemented in the second half of this year. </li>
<li>On criminal legal aid, the number of accused persons assisted per year has risen after the Government introduced direct funding in 2015. CLAS assisted almost 1,600 cases in 2018, almost 4 times the number of cases assisted pre-2015 before the Government funding. </li>
<li>We will continue to review these schemes to ensure that persons of limited means, the right target clientele for these schemes, will remain assisted and will have access to justice. </li>
</ol>

{:start="23"}
23. Mdm Rahayu also asked about supporting lawyers’ low bono efforts. We are working with our partners, the Law Society Pro Bono Services and the Singapore Academy of Law to study how we can enhance support for pro bono and low bono efforts.

{:start="24"}
24. Mr Chen Show Mao also asked about legal aid for arbitration in disputes over consumer contracts. As a general rule, legal aid is not provided for arbitration because it is a private, consensual dispute resolution mechanism and it is typically used for high value commercial dispute resolution.

<ol start="25">
<li>Nevertheless, I would like to assure Mr Chen, there are several avenues available for such consumers to seek assistance and redress. Let me just outline a few:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Before consumers undergo arbitration, they can obtain free legal advice from Legal Aid Bureau (LAB) on the arbitration clauses in the contract. </li>
<li>This can help consumers better understand their rights and obligations under the contract, and Legal Aid Bureau can also provide substantive advice on legal options available to the consumer. </li>
<li>Consumers who wish to resolve their dispute by arbitration in a quick and cost-effective manner can consider the Law Society’s Pro Bono Arbitration Scheme, which adopts streamlined procedures and waives the fees of the sole arbitrator. </li>
<li>If the consumer wishes to challenge the arbitration clause or the arbitration award, he can apply for legal aid for representation in Court and Legal Aid Bureau will represent such consumers if there are legal merits in his case. </li>

</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="26"}
26. That said, if Mr Chen could provide us with a specific case that he has encountered, such as the example you cited last week, where the consumer had no choice over the entry into the contract, my Ministry will review the case and see what we can do to assist. We will also continue to monitor developments in this area with MTI – since it concerns consumer protection – and consider whether further steps need to be taken.


<ol start="3">
<li style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">Theme 1A: Growing the Intellectual Property Sector for the Future Economy</li>
</ol>

{:start="27"}
27. A number of Members have asked specifically about the Intellectual Property (IP) regime in Singapore and I’ll turn to that next. The Minister for Finance spoke about positioning Singapore as a “Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise” for our next phase of growth, so these are quite pertinent questions which members have raised.  My Ministry’s efforts in the area of IP will support this push in four major ways.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Positioning our IP system to better support creators and innovators.</li>
</ol>

{:start="28"}
28. First, we are positioning our IP system to better support creators and innovators.

<ol start="29">
<li>  Mr Tay asked about protecting the IP rights of creators. We will be amending the Copyright Act to better support creators in this digital age.  For example:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> Creators will find it easier to build their reputation as people who use their works will then have to properly acknowledge the creators; and </li>
<li>Creators of certain commissioned works will enjoy default ownership of their works, whereas previously the commissioning party would own the works. </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

{:start="30"}
30. As for innovators, innovative businesses in data analytics will find it easier to mine data for analysis. Details can be found in the Copyright Review Report, a fairly comprehensive report, which was released in January 2019.

{:start="31"}
31. At the same time, we are also reviewing the IP dispute resolution system to make it more accessible, especially for individuals and SMEs, so that they can more effectively safeguard their rights. We held a public consultation on proposed reforms in late 2018, and we are now studying the feedback received from the community for the next phase.
 
{:start="32"} 
32. Mr Tay also asked about helping Fintech start-ups to protect their IP. Last year, the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) introduced a FinTech Fast Track Initiative which accelerates the file-to-grant period of deserving FinTech patents to approximately 6 months, in place of the usual 2 to 4 years. IPOS will extend this initiative for a further year, to 25 April 2020. FinTech start-ups can also avail themselves of the other assistance schemes available to Singapore businesses, some of which I am going to highlight.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li> Helping enterprises protect and use IP</li>
</ol>

<ol start="33">
<li>  Second, we are helping Singapore businesses in commercialising their IP. Ms Jessica Tan asked about this. There are various forms of assistance already available to enterprises, in particular SMEs and start-ups, on IP strategy and management:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> Businesses that need preliminary advice on IP strategies to support their business plans or on IP legal issues can tap on IPOS’ IP Business Clinics and Legal Clinics. These are available to small businesses, individuals, sole proprietors and approximately 600 businesses have benefited from these clinics since 2015.</li>
<li>IPOS also provides specialised consultancy services on IP audit, due diligence and strategy to help enterprises identify their intangible assets and integrate them into their strategies for growth and expansion. About 80 enterprises have benefited from these services, with close to 90% of them being SMEs and start-ups.</li>
<li>When enterprises seek assistance in developing their IP strategy management capabilities, eligible costs may be defrayed under Enterprise Singapore’s Market Readiness Assistance Grant, and Enterprise Development Grant.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="34">
<li> While there is still some way to go in encouraging businesses to leverage their IP for growth and take advantage of the IP ecosystem,  we have seen a number of success stories.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>One example is OTSAW Digital, an SME which builds autonomous robots for the security industry. </li>
<li>IPOS assisted the company in developing its IP strategy to protect and manage its IP and thereafter, exploit it, as well as other intangible assets. </li>
<li>OTSAW now has internal processes to identify IP that is developed and to protect it appropriately. It is also more aware of IP related issues when negotiating with business partners and potential investors. </li>
<li>The company is now expanding internationally into the Malaysian, Indonesian and Chinese markets and we are naturally excited to see them grow, as they leverage on their startup position and their IP rights and look forward to observing their continued success. </li>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li> Making it easier for businesses to commercialise IP from the public sector.</li>
</ol>

{:start="35"}
35. Third, we are making it easier for businesses to commercialise IP from the public sector. The National IP Protocol was developed and rolled out in April 2018 to encourage commercialisation of public sector IP and R&D outputs. It streamlines IP practices in our public research institutes, universities and public agencies to reduce the time and effort needed to structure commercialisation arrangements with the private sector. This will foster greater collaboration between private sector businesses on one hand and the public sector on the other.


<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>  Creating better jobs for Singaporeans in the growing IP sector</li>
</ol>

{:start="36"}
36. Finally, and in response to Ms Tan’s question on job opportunities, we have several initiatives to develop talent and create jobs in the IP sector.

{:start="37"}
37. IPOS has partnered SkillsFuture Singapore to develop the first national level skills development framework for the IP sector. This will be rolled out in August 2019. This framework will provide comprehensive information on the career options, skills needed for the various job roles, and the relevant training programmes in the IP sector. This will aid in the upskilling of new entrants and existing IP professionals.
 
{:start="38"} 
38. IPOS has also partnered with Workforce Singapore on the IP Professional Conversion Programme, and with SkillsFuture Singapore on the SkillsFuture Study Awards. These schemes provide financial support for the reskilling of newly hired employees, and for individuals who are seeking to deepen and also to broaden their skills.

{:start="39"}
39. We are also developing programmes to ensure that trained individuals are recognised with certifications. For example, IPOS launched a Specialist Certificate in Intangible Asset Management in January 2019, and collaborated with the Singapore University of Social Sciences to launch a Master of IP and Innovation Management programme in 2017. This year, the first batch of 14 students is expected to graduate from this programme, with another 21 expected in the next cohort.

{:start="40"}
40. All these measures work towards ensuring that our legal system meets the needs of all – whether it be the man on the street or businesses, large or small , all that call Singapore home.
 
{:start="41"} 
41. Our legal system as a whole also plays a broader role as a supporting pillar for the next phase of Singapore’s economic transformation.

<ol start="42">
<li>On this, there are two interlocking aspects of my Ministry’s efforts to provide this support effectively:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>First, we are strengthening Singapore’s position as an international legal services hub. </li>
<li>Second, we are working to establish Singapore as a thought leader of international rule of law and pursuing international cooperation. </li>
 
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="43">
<li> These mutually reinforcing efforts work together to underpin our position, in an increasingly uncertain world, as a trusted, stable centre for law and business. And I’d like to elaborate on these few points now .</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li style="border-bottom: 1px solid black"> Theme 2A: Strengthening Singapore as an international legal services hub</li>
</ol>

<ol start="44">
<li>  We are investing in strengthening Singapore’s position as a premier legal services hub, both regionally as well as globally.  This means:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> Strengthening our position as a centre for dispute resolution;</li>
<li> Growing new areas to meet the demands of international legal services; and</li>
<li> Finally, promoting the use of Singapore law to meet business needs.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>International hub for dispute resolution</li>
</ol>


{:start="45"}
45. There are three broad categories of efforts relating to dispute resolution.

<ol start="46">
<li>  First, we are, we have been and we continue to position  Singapore as a <u>trusted and neutral forum for dispute resolution</u>. We have done well in international dispute resolution, and will continue to build on these efforts to further enhance our position:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We are now the 3rd most preferred seat of arbitration globally. </li>
<li>The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is also the 3rd most preferred arbitral institution in the world. </li>
<li>SIAC, along with the Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC) for mediation and the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC), have all seen increases in caseload over the years.
        
<ul>        
<li>SIAC: Highest caseload of 452 cases in 2017, of which 83% were international in nature. </li>
<li>SIMC: As of 31 Dec 2018, it had received a total of 68 case filings from parties from more than 20 different jurisdictions. </li>
<li>SICC: 29 cases have reached the SICC since it was established in 2015.</li>
        
</ul>       
</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="47">
<li> Mr Murali Pillai asked for an update on the SICC. Beyond just the  caseload alone, what the SICC has  been working very hard on is to enhance the enforceability of SICC judgements.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>  In 2018, our Supreme Court and the Supreme People’s Court of China signed a Memorandum of Guidance (MOG) on the recognition and enforcement of money judgments in commercial cases.</li>
<li>This means that parties who have commercial dealings, are much clearer on how any money judgments arising from disputes, can be enforced against the other party, whether in Singapore or China.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="48">
<li> Mr Murali also asked for an update on third-party funding for international arbitration. My Ministry has conducted a public consultation to obtain feedback from stakeholders on how the reforms have been working in practice. We also asked if there was a need to extend third-party funding to new areas.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> Generally, the feedback received has been positive, Mr Murali will be pleased to know. Funders have seen an upturn in their requests for funding in Singapore and there was support for extension.</li>
<li>We are currently reviewing the framework, including areas for potential extension such as proceedings commenced in the SICC and any appeals from the SICC .    </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="49">
<li>Second, we must continue to invest in order to strengthen our leadership position:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> We are bolstering our infrastructure to meet demand and support growth. The expansion of Maxwell Chambers is on track. The newly refurbished building located next to it, the Maxwell Chambers Suites will be launched in 3Q 2019.</li>
<li>This will add 120,000 square feet of floor space and triple Maxwell Chambers’ current size.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>



<ol start="50">
<li>   But it is not just about size or how big the physical infrastructure, we need to  deepen our collaborations with international institutions.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>  And on this score, we have attracted top arbitral institutions to set up offices in Singapore –
<ul>
<li> The International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC Court) has set up a case management office here.</li>
<li>The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)’s new office in Singapore and it is its first in Asia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The SIAC signed MOUs with a number of Chinese institutions in 2018 alone:
<ul>
<li>China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC), one of the leading commissions in China for dispute resolution, an MOU was signed in 2018; the </li>
<li>Likewise, an MOU was also signed with the Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration (SCIA); and the </li>
<li> Xi’an Arbitration Commission (XAC) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>    The SIMC also signed an MOU in 2018 with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help resolve disputes that may arise in infrastructure public-private partnership (PPP) projects, and an MOU with the China Council for Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) Mediation Centre in January 2019.</li>

</ol>
</li>

</ol>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Capturing demand for legal services in high-growth practice areas</li>
</ol>


{:start="51"}
51. Further to our efforts in enhancing Singapore’s attractiveness as a forum for dispute resolution, we have also identified several high-growth practice areas to develop.
 

{:start="52"} 
52. First, in the area of <u>insolvency and debt restructuring</u>. We amended the Companies Act previously and now we have got an omnibus was passed in 2018, the Insolvency Restructuring and Dissolution Act, was the final piece of principal legislation in our phased implementation of the recommendations of the Insolvency Law Review Committee and the Committee to Strengthen Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Structuring. So we now have legislation that seeks to properly balance the interests of debtors and creditors undergoing restructuring in Singapore.


{:start="53"}
53. The Act, which we target to bring into force this year, benefits local businesses needing help, positions Singapore as a location of choice for foreign debtors to restructure, and creates new opportunities for insolvency professionals, distressed debt funds and financial institutions.

<ol start="54">
<li>Second, in the area of <u>Projects and Infrastructure</u>. We have taken a number of steps to capture the increasing demand for legal services in this area.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Infrastructure Asia, Singapore’s infrastructure office, was launched in October 2018.

<ul>
<li>The office was set up by Monetary Authority of Singapore, Enterprise Singapore, and supported by MinLaw through the Professional Services Programme Office (PSPO).</li>
<li>It provides a platform for information exchange on infrastructure opportunities in Asia, facilitates investments and financing, and gives Singapore-based infrastructure players access to these opportunities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>  In the same month, we also launched the Singapore Infrastructure Dispute-Management Protocol (SIDP).
<ul>
<li>The Protocol helps parties proactively manage differences to prevent them from escalating into disputes, and minimise the risks of time and cost overruns, all of which aimed at enhancing and improving on the large scale infrastructure ecosystem in Singapore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li> Promoting Singapore law</li>
</ol>


{:start="55"}
55. Mr de Souza has rightly pointed out that Singapore’s position as an international legal services hub can be further strengthened by promoting the use of Singapore law. We agree and Singapore Law is well placed to meet the legal needs of businesses in Asia, particularly those businesses that are familiar or accustomed to English Common Law.


{:start="56"}
56. Singapore law benefits from its roots in the English common law, but has gone on to evolve to remain modern and relevant. Overlaid on our common law, are legal frameworks and statutes which are often developed in close consultation with industry users. Those who choose Singapore law choose to do so as they wish to tap into a legal system that is not just familiar but one which is trusted both in Singapore as well as internationally.

<ol start="57">
<li>The promotion of Singapore law does not just involve government stakeholders, but is also driven from the ground-up, by the Bar and from others within the ecosystem. For example –

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>  In October 2018 the Singapore Academy of Law and the Singapore Venture Capital & Private Equity Association launched the Venture Capital Investment Model Agreements (VIMA). This suite of standard-form documents makes the process of structuring a deal faster, quicker and more cost-efficient for start-ups and venture capital (VC) firms. VIMA incorporates Singapore law as the governing law and Singapore as the chosen dispute resolution forum.</li>
<li> My Ministry also works with the universities to encourage research that helps to develop and strengthen Singapore Law. The intent is to ensure that our law remains cutting-edge, but also one that meets the needs of modern businesses.</li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>
 
{:start="58"}
58. We continue to welcome views and suggestions from practitioners and businesses on how we can further strengthen and enhance these laws.

<ol start="5">
<li style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">Theme 2B: Establishing singapore as thought leader of international rule of law and Pursuing international cooperation</li>
</ol>


{:start="59"}
59. We continue to welcome views and suggestions from practitioners and businesses on how we can further strengthen and enhance these laws.

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Establishing Singapore as a thought leader in international rule of law efforts</li>
</ol>


<ol start="60">
<li>First, we want to establish Singapore as an advocate of, and thought leader in, international rule of law efforts.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li> The Singapore Convention on Mediation will be the first convention under the UN auspices to be named after Singapore. This reinforces Singapore’s reputation brand as a forum of choice, for cross-border dispute resolution and also other form of alternative dispute resolution.</li>
<li>  We also engage actively in international efforts to design new international rules, to ensure that Singapore’s perspectives and our unique circumstances are not ignored.      
<ul>
<li>  For example, my Ministry, together with other ministries, worked to secure Singapore’s re-election as member of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law from 2019. This will enable Singapore to continue to actively participate in the development of international trade law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have also worked hard to promote international law scholarship, particularly in the ASEAN Law context.  For instance, we supported the launch of the ASEAN Law Academy at NUS last year.    </li>
</ol>

</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Pursuing International Legal Cooperation</li>
</ol>

{:start="61"}
61. At the same time, we must also ensure that we are a responsible global citizen, if we are to maintain the trust of the international community. There are two aspects to international cooperation that I will touch on: criminal cooperation, and civil cooperation.

<ol start="62">
<li>As a sign of our commitment to international cooperation to combat transnational crime:

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>  We concluded the Model ASEAN Extradition Treaty in 2018, and launched the commencement of negotiations for an ASEAN Extradition Treaty; and</li>
<li>  We also launched the commencement of negotiations on a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with China.</li>
</ol>

</li>

63. We are pursuing a number of efforts in the area of civil cooperation. Mr Murali Pillai asked whether Singapore intends to accede to the Hague Apostille Convention. My Ministry is currently studying the possibility of doing so. We have begun discussions with stakeholders, and have also engaged representatives from the Hague Conference, about the practicalities and the steps needed  in implementing the Convention.

{:start="64"}
64. All these efforts translate into more opportunities for Singapore Law Practices. Both Mr De Souza and Mdm Rahayu have asked how Singapore law practices are being assisted to take advantage of the opportunities created for them. 
 
{:start="65"}
65. The final area that I will therefore cover relates to our efforts to support SLPs to adapt and go beyond to take advantage of these  opportunities in this broader landscape. Broadly, we are supporting SLPs in four ways.



<ol start="6">
<li style="border-bottom: 1px solid black"> Theme 3: Supporting Singapore Law Practices to be future-ready</li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>New Business Areas</li>
</ol>

{:start="66"}
66. First, new business areas. To sustain their business in the face of competition and technological disruption, as Mdm Rahayu has pointed out, law firms need to venture into new practice areas, we can’t keep holding on to the conventional ones. My Ministry will continue to help Singapore lawyers develop capabilities in high growth practice areas.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>For example, we worked with the NUS Faculty of Law to roll out “The Project Finance Academy”, a three-day practical hands-on workshop in November 2018 to take participants through the main legal considerations in structuring project finance transactions and negotiating infrastructure deals.</li>
</ol>

{:start="67"}
67. We also encourage and support law firms to develop new practice areas and access regional opportunities. In response to Mdm Rahayu’s suggestion on CPD courses, the Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) and the Law Society of Singapore have been developing various CPD programmes and courses designed in a new way to equip practitioners interested in deepening or building their practices in new areas. Some of these programmes are approved for SkillsFuture credits, Ms Rahayu might like to know. And of course, the feedback that has been given by Ms Rahayu last week, we will share with SAL and Law Society.

{:start="68"}
68. On Ms Rahayu’s point about providing customised consultancy services to small and medium firms, SAL’s Future Law Innovation Programme (FLIP) recently launched an initiative, where for as low as $1,500, small and medium law firms in Singapore can engage a consultant to review their work flows and advise how they can better harness and adopt technology to operate more efficiently. And perhaps more importantly, for these small firms also more cost effectively.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Internationalisation</li>
</ol>

{:start="69"}
69. Second, <u>internationalisation</u>. MinLaw is supporting the efforts of SLPs to capture a greater share of international demand for legal services. In other words, look not just at Singapore as the market, but to go beyond Singapore into the region and globally.
 
{:start="70"} 
70. Together with the Law Society of Singapore and the then-International Enterprise Singapore, we launched the Lawyers Go Global programme in Feb 2018.

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The programme helps lawyers expand their networks beyond Singapore through mission trips, training and a branding exercise for the Singapore lawyer brand. </li>
<li>In the last 12 months, close to 60 lawyers have participated in 3 mission trips. </li>   
<li>We have also stepped up our engagements in Asia. My Ministry has led our law firms and institutions on promotion trips to Asian countries. I visited China earlier this year to strengthen Singapore-China legal and judicial cooperation. </li>
<li>During my visit, I attended and spoke at the “China-Singapore International Commercial Dispute Resolution Conference”, the first of its kind  jointly organised by Singapore and China. </li>
<li>Prior to this visit, 24 lawyers from six leading firms in China’s Shaanxi province undertook a one-month attachment in Singapore as part of a MinLaw initiative to help Chinese lawyers better understand what Singapore has to offer as a business hub for Chinese companies as well as to help Singapore lawyers connect with their Chinese counterparts and learn about and tap into opportunities in China and the BRI. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color:#900">
<li>Adoption of technology</li>
</ol>

{:start="71"}
71. Third, <u>adoption of technology</u>. We are supporting law practices’ efforts to keep up to date with technology.

<ol start="72">
<li>So members might like to know that under the Tech Start for Law scheme, SLPs were given 70% funding:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>115 Singapore Law Practices, of which 99% are small and medium sized ones, have collectively adopted 143 technology solutions.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

{:start="73"}
73. In the longer term, MinLaw will be working with A*STAR to develop a broader term  roadmap up to 2030 in identifying technologies that will impact and change the delivery of legal services.

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; color: #900">
<li>Development of legal talent</li>
</ol>


{:start="74"}
74. Fourth, <u>development of legal talent;</u> not just for lawyers but also for sub-specialities like paralegals.

 We continue to work with the law schools to ensure that the curriculum, the training is robust and prepares our lawyers and paralegals for future generations.
 
<ol start="75">
<li>We will also continue to support Singapore lawyers to deepen their skills through the SkillsFuture programme as I mentioned earlier.
 
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>  Members might like to know that since 2016, in the context of supporting Singapore lawyers, 78 Singaporean lawyers and in-house counsel have successfully applied for the SkillsFuture Study Award for the legal sector to hone leadership skills in the management of their own law firms. So the SAL and INSEAD runs the SAL-INSEAD Law Firm Leadership Programme (SILLP). At the same time, Skills Future also supports  qualifications for solicitors to seek admission as solicitors of England and Wales through the Qualified Lawyers Transfer Scheme (QLTS).</li>
<li>  From 1 April 2019 onwards, we will also be supporting lawyers who wish to take the New York State Bar exam, through the SkillsFuture Study Award as well.</li>
</ol>
 
</li>
</ol>
 
{:start="76"}
76. The role of paralegals is growing and we recognise the integral role that they and other legal support professionals play in the legal industry.  So we will continue to work with SAL, their programme of the SAL’s Legal Industry Framework for Training and Education (LIFTED) for paralegals, which maps out the competency and training that paralegals need to move up the value chain and support legal services. We will continue to work with the SAL on this.  
 
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>    In addition, we have provided pathways for paralegals who wish to upskill and advance their career in the legal sector through training and education. For example, at least 80% of the places at the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) Law School are set aside for mature students, including paralegals.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="7">
<li style="border-bottom: 1px solid black">Conclusion: Continue to work with ALL STAKEHOLDERS to ensure justice for all</li>
</ol>


{:start="77"}
77. Allow me to conclude now, as I mentioned earlier, we asked ourselves – what purposes must the legal framework serve?


{:start="78"}
78. We must have a legal framework that is fair, is transparent, is updated, remains relevant to the users of the system, and most importantly, underpinned by a strong rule of law. it must then meet the needs of individuals and businesses who call Singapore home. We do this through ensuring that our criminal, civil and family justice frameworks are up to date, and making sure that persons of limited means have and will continue to have effective access to justice. 


{:start="79"}
79. Second, on a broader level, the legal framework must support Singapore’s continuing economic growth. This is especially crucial as we enter a season of global economic uncertainty. While it will pose challenges, there will also be many opportunities from these challenges and disruptions that we can reap if we can leverage our position as a stable and trusted centre for law and business.


{:start="80"}
80. None of this however, can be done by government alone. In particular, I want to record my thanks to members of the Bar for their numerous contributions to the work of my Ministry. Many have given their time and expertise to sit on our committees, give feedback during consultations, and collaborate with us on our many initiatives, both locally and overseas.  I am grateful for their close involvement in all that we do and I look forward to building on this strong relationship.  On our end, we will continue to work with all stakeholders, to achieve all of the objectives I have just set out. Thank you, Mr Chairman.
