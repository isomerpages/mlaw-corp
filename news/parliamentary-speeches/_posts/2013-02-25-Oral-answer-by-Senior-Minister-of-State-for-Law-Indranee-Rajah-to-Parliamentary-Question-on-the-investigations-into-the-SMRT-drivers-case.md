**Mr Yee Jenn Jong, Non-Constituency Member**

**<u>Question</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law with regard to the investigations into claims by former SMRT bus drivers of police brutality (a) whether the attempted retention or confiscation of a laptop, desktop computer and mobile phone belonging to a film maker at her residence by Singapore Police Force officers is in conformity with proper procedures and requirements of the Criminal Procedure Code; and (b) what is the legal basis for the attempted retention or confiscation.

**<u>Oral Answer</u>**  
The allegations of police brutality against the former SMRT drivers, which were posted on the website “Lianain Films” on 28 January, are serious allegations. They are currently being investigated by the Police Internal Affairs Office.

Notwithstanding these allegations, the drivers have indicated through their counsel that they intend to plead guilty to the criminal charges preferred against them. I understand that the case is scheduled for this afternoon.

It is best if we deal with this issue after all the relevant proceedings are over. If the Member were to file this question again at that point in time, a full account will be given of the case.
