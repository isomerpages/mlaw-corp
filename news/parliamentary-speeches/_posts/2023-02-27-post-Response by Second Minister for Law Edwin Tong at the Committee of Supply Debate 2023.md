Mr Speaker,

{:start="1"}
1.	Madam Chairman, good evening. 

{:start="2"}
2.	We are living in a time of change. 

(a) Spurred by profound developments in the world, including all the experiences
Members have been speaking about:

(i) Geopolitical tensions;

(ii) Reconfiguration of economic value chains;

(iii) Technological developments;

(iv) Sustainability and climate change; and

(v) The recently passed COVID-19 pandemic, of which we have seen the worst of and hopefully, it has been put behind us.

(b) And within Singapore as well –

(i) An ageing population; and

(ii) An increasingly educated and skilled workforce.

{:start="3"}
3.	All of these factors inter-twined together, developing and reshaping the way we live, work and also interact with one another. 

{:start="4"}
4.	To ensure that Singapore continues to thrive amidst these changes, the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) is working on various fronts.

{:start="5"}
5.	The scope, as I think you can see from the breadth of topics raised by Members, is diverse:

a) Increasing access to justice;

(b) Enhancing the legal processes;

(c) Optimising land utilisation and promoting land data; and

(d) Assisting businesses with protecting their intangible assets and intellectual property, and finding a platform for these to be commercialised and leveraged, for the industry to grow.

6.	While the work is wide-ranging, our vision is singular: Bettering people’s lives, creating value jobs, and advancing our economy and society, through laws and policies. That ultimately is the bottomline and the topline of what we do at MinLaw

7.	This is perhaps best encapsulated by our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which Mr Murali Pillai commended.

8.	Our efforts provided reprieve to the affected businesses and individuals.

(a) We amended various pieces of legislation and also enacted the COVID-19
(Temporary Measures) Act, which itself was amended eight times since it was
passed, to refine Singapore’s response to the evolving and developing situation
as we faced COVID-19, and its impact on businesses.
(b) These measures covered a broad range of issues, such as adjusting contractual
obligations, providing rental relief, and supporting distressed entities through
insolvency.

9.	Many of these steps are unprecedented and novel, but also highly necessary.

10.	Mr Murali said we should chronicle our efforts as we went through these different challenges to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. We have accumulated that experience, and will do so. In fact, we have captured the gains that we have already made.

(a) For example, we have made permanent, the powers of our courts to conduct
proceedings through electronic means such as video-conferencing.
(b) We are also considering whether some features of the Simplified Insolvency
Programme can be adopted permanently – something I spoke about in
Parliament not long ago.

11.	Moving forward, my ministry will work along three broad thrusts:
(a) First, enhancing the trust, relevance and accessibility of our legal system for
society;
(b) Second, contributing to and supporting economic activity in Singapore – by
identifying and seizing new opportunities in the legal and intellectual property
sectors; and
(c) Third, optimising and rejuvenating our land and properties for the community.

12.	SPS Rahayu Mahzam and I will address these themes and also address, as far as we
can, the cuts that have been raised by Members.

**I. Enhancing Trust, Relevance and Accessibility of our Legal System**

13.	xxxx




13. Last year, we saw the culmination of various initiatives that improved the efficiency,
effectiveness and also the accessibility of our legal system. This included:
(a) Establishing the Sentencing Advisory Panel and the Public Defender’s Office;
and
(b) Passing the Post-appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill 2022.
14. We will continue in this vein to drive reforms, and SPS Rahayu will elaborate on these
programmes.
Community Dispute Management Framework (CDMF)
