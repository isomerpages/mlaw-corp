Mr Speaker,

{:start="1"}
1.	Madam Chairman, good evening. 

{:start="2"}
2.	We are living in a time of change. 

(a) Spurred by profound developments in the world, including all the experiences
Members have been speaking about:

(i) Geopolitical tensions;

(ii) Reconfiguration of economic value chains;

(iii) Technological developments;

(iv) Sustainability and climate change; and

(v) The recently passed COVID-19 pandemic, of which we have seen the worst of and hopefully, it has been put behind us.

(b) And within Singapore as well –

(i) An ageing population; and

(ii) An increasingly educated and skilled workforce.

{:start="3"}
3.	All of these factors inter-twined together, developing and reshaping the way we live, work and also interact with one another. 

{:start="4"}
4.	To ensure that Singapore continues to thrive amidst these changes, the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) is working on various fronts.

{:start="5"}
5.	The scope, as I think you can see from the breadth of topics raised by Members, is diverse:

a) Increasing access to justice;

(b) Enhancing the legal processes;

(c) Optimising land utilisation and promoting land data; and

(d) Assisting businesses with protecting their intangible assets and intellectual property, and finding a platform for these to be commercialised and leveraged, for the industry to grow.

6.	While the work is wide-ranging, our vision is singular: Bettering people’s lives, creating value jobs, and advancing our economy and society, through laws and policies. That ultimately is the bottomline and the topline of what we do at MinLaw

7.	This is perhaps best encapsulated by our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which Mr Murali Pillai commended.

8.	Our efforts provided reprieve to the affected businesses and individuals.

(a) We amended various pieces of legislation and also enacted the COVID-19
(Temporary Measures) Act, which itself was amended eight times since it was
passed, to refine Singapore’s response to the evolving and developing situation
as we faced COVID-19, and its impact on businesses.
(b) These measures covered a broad range of issues, such as adjusting contractual
obligations, providing rental relief, and supporting distressed entities through
insolvency.

9.	Many of these steps are unprecedented and novel, but also highly necessary.

10.	Mr Murali said we should chronicle our efforts as we went through these different challenges to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. We have accumulated that experience, and will do so. In fact, we have captured the gains that we have already made.

(a) For example, we have made permanent, the powers of our courts to conduct
proceedings through electronic means such as video-conferencing.
(b) We are also considering whether some features of the Simplified Insolvency
Programme can be adopted permanently – something I spoke about in
Parliament not long ago.

11.	Moving forward, my ministry will work along three broad thrusts:
(a) First, enhancing the trust, relevance and accessibility of our legal system for
society;
(b) Second, contributing to and supporting economic activity in Singapore – by
identifying and seizing new opportunities in the legal and intellectual property
sectors; and
(c) Third, optimising and rejuvenating our land and properties for the community.

12.	SPS Rahayu Mahzam and I will address these themes and also address, as far as we
can, the cuts that have been raised by Members.

**I. Enhancing Trust, Relevance and Accessibility of our Legal System**

13.	Last year, we saw the culmination of various initiatives that improved the efficiency,
effectiveness and also the accessibility of our legal system. This included:
(a) Establishing the Sentencing Advisory Panel and the Public Defender’s Office;
and
(b) Passing the Post-appeal Applications in Capital Cases Bill 2022.

14.	We will continue in this vein to drive reforms, and SPS Rahayu will elaborate on these programmes.

<u><i>Community Dispute Management Framework (CDMF)</i></u>

15.	Let me start by addressing the queries on the Community Dispute Management Framework (CDMF) which various Members have raised, including Mr Pillai, Mr Patrick Tay, Mr Derrick Goh, and Mr Dennis Tan, amongst others, about the framework and its role in resolving community disputes.

16. As Members are aware, an inter-agency committee led by MCCY, together with MND, is conducting a comprehensive review of the CDMF.

17. The goal is threefold: to encourage pro-social behaviour, facilitate amicable resolution
of disputes between neighbours and third, to deal with this, as far as possible, at an early stage.

18. To achieve this, we are looking at enhancements in three broad areas.

(a) First, early intervention – by building consensus through community norms.
(i) This will set shared expectations on acceptable community behaviour; set
out standards, to help shape normative behaviour in the community.
(ii) SMS Sim Ann will share more details of this when she speaks at MND’s
COS.

(b) Second, and we all know this, despite setting these norms, having these norms
in the community – nuisance might and would still likely occur, but perhaps at a
reduced rate. The overall aim is to encourage conciliation between neighbours,
as much as possible. We live in an environment where we are close to one
another. The best solution to dealing with neighbour disputes is to find an
amicable, mediated position.
(i) We are therefore going to be looking at setting up a team of dedicated
personnel to leverage stronger laws and more active facilitation to help
neighbours resolve issues upstream, before matters escalate and
relationships deteriorate to such an extent that matters become
intransigent or deadlocked.
(ii) In appropriate cases, these personnel from this team may conduct
investigations to understand the nature and root cause of the problem, and
require, in the right cases, residents to attend a mandatory mediation, or
require them to stop the actions that are causing the nuisance, pending
mediation or resolution downstream.
(iii) More details for this process will be shared in MND’s and MCCY’s COS in
due course.

(c) But let me explain MinLaw’s work in the third area, which is in enhancing and
improving the dispute resolution framework.
(i) As I said, even as we look at steps to enhance and improve this process,
we intend to channel as much of these disputes as possible through the
mediated conciliatory route – that I think, we all accept is the best way of
resolving a neighbour dispute.
(ii) But given that there will be a number of these intransigent cases, we will
work towards strengthening the powers and processes of the Community
Disputes Resolution Tribunal (CDRT), which some Members spoke about
