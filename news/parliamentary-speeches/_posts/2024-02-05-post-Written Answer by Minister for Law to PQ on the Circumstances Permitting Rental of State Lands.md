Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member of Parliament)

<b><u>Question</u></b>

<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) other than temporary hawker centres, what other circumstances are state lands allowed to be rented to private individuals at zero cost or below market cost; and (b) what are the justifications for doing so.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}

1. The Government's policy is to charge market rates for the use of State land. The Singapore Land Authority, as the custodian of State land and properties, applies this policy to users of State land under its charge.&nbsp;

{:start="2"}

2. Waivers or subsidies for rental of State land such as for interim uses are considered only on an exceptional and case-by-case basis. Examples include non-commercial and non-exclusive public uses, such as the construction and maintenance of public walkways, and where tenants have to relocate temporarily due to reasons beyond their control, such as public works.
