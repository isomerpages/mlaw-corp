<b>Mr Leong Mun Wai (Non-Constituency Member of Parliament)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) what is the total land area and built-in area respectively occupied by black-and-white bungalows in Singapore; (b) what is the occupancy rate of black-and-white bungalows as of 30 June 2023; and (c) what is the median vacancy period.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp; As the custodian of State land and properties, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) oversees the management of about 2,600 State properties, including around 600 heritage Black and White bungalows.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp; It has previously been explained in detail in Parliament on 3 July 2023 that SLA deploys State properties to a variety of different uses. In the same way, the surrounding State land is used in a variety of ways, having regard to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Master Plan. For heritage bungalows which are located within landed estates and rented out for residential use, the adjacent State land which does not have an alternative specified use may be included in the tenancy boundary. For cases where the bungalows are put to other uses such as commercial use, the adjacent land can be used for other purposes like place-making and may be excluded from the tenancy boundary.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp; It has also been explained in Parliament that SLA has carefully broadened the usage of these heritage bungalows to meet the evolving needs in Singapore, bearing in mind the URA Master Plan and the need for a judicious balance between protecting heritage properties and redeveloping them altogether.

4. The occupancy rates of these heritage bungalows have generally moved in tandem with changes in market conditions.
