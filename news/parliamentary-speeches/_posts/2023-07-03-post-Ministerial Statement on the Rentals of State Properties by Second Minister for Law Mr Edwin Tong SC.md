**A.    INTRODUCTION**    
 
{:start="1"}
1.  Mr Deputy Speaker,

(1) I will respond to the remaining questions by Members relating to the rentals of Black and Whites managed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).

(2) Specifically, I will address Members’ questions raised in relation to SLA’s management of Black and Whites.

(3) And I will refer to the various Parliamentary Questions which I will address in the course of this speech.
 
{:start="2"}
2.  Sir, the main issues raised in these remaining PQs are as follows:

(1) First, what is SLA’s policy mandate and objectives in managing State properties, including Black and Whites?&nbsp; Why do we continue to maintain such a portfolio of older, historical properties, and what is SLA’s management strategy for such properties?

(2) Specifically, what is the process by which residential Black and Whites are leased out? And

(3) Finally, whether, in the case of No. 26 and 31 Ridout Road, SLA took any unusual steps or measures that deviated from its usual process?
    
{:start="3"}
3. On this last point, the short answer is that SLA complied with all its procedures and requirements in these transactions:

(1) SLA adhered to its internal processes, guidelines and requirements in leasing both properties.

(2) The properties were rented at market value, determined by an independent team of valuers who, as you heard from SM earlier, were not aware of the identities of the prospective tenants at the time of the transaction.

(3) SLA acted properly:
			
			a. It sought at all times to achieve a commercially viable outcome.
			b. Which would secure its interests, as Landlord, and also as manager of the State properties.
			c. In addition, Minister Shanmugam recused himself, as Minister for Law, from any decisions and discussions related to the issue of his own tenancy, should any matter arise.
    
{:start="4"}
4.  This is validated by the findings of the independent review conducted by Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security, Mr Teo Chee Hean, which you heard earlier, and the investigation by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB).&nbsp; Members would have heard SM’s speech in this House.

{:start="5"}
5.  These conclusions were reached after a rigorous investigation by CPIB, which also inquired into SLA’s conduct as the landlord:

(1) Numerous SLA officers, both former and current, as well as SLA’s property and managing agents, were interviewed by CPIB officers, some of them on multiple occasions.

(2) SLA’s processes were closely reviewed, including through the requisition of contemporaneous documents ranging from emails, the leasing documents and approval chain, to messages on private messaging applications.

(3) Following this investigation, CPIB found that the rules were applied fairly for both rental transactions.&nbsp; It was established that:

			a. There was no evidence of corruption or wrongdoing in the two rental transactions of the Ridout Road State properties.
			b. The Direct Tenancy rules were applied fairly for both rental transactions.&nbsp; There was no corrupt intent on the part of any person, or any inducement given to any individual involved in the processing of rentals.
			c. No preferential treatment was given to the Ministers and their spouses.
			d. There was no disclosure of privileged information in the process.
			e. There was also no evidence to suggest any abuse of position by the Ministers for personal gain.
    
{:start="6"}
6.  Sir, to address the remaining PQs, I will organise my speech as follows:

(1) First, I will set out the contextual background against which Members’ questions arise:

			a. Starting with a brief outline of the nature of Black and Whites.
			b. And explain the value which they have in Singapore as heritage properties, having historical and architectural significance.
			c. I will then set out SLA’s management strategy concerning these older, heritage properties, including Black and Whites.

(2) Next, I will outline SLA’s management approach to these properties, covering the questions of:

			a. Marketing;
			b. Valuation; and
			c. Leasing
			
Which members have raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It would also be useful, as we deal with these commercial questions, to have regard to the state of the residential rental market at the relevant time, a question which Mr Don Wee had posed.

(3) Finally, I will deal with some specific queries raised in relation to:

			a. The two leases, for 26 and 31 Ridout Road.
			b. And also address SLA’s approach in undertaking these transactions.
    
**B.   SLA’S MANAGEMENT OF BLACK AND WHITE**    

*SLA’s role in management of State properties*

{:start="7"}
7.  Mr Leong Mun Wai, Mr Don Wee, Mr Gerald Giam and Ms He Ting Ru have asked about SLA’s management of Black and White bungalows (“Black and Whites”), including its plans for such Black and Whites and the context in which they are maintained, including broader development plans.
    
{:start="8"}
8.  Let me start with some background.
    
{:start="9"}
9.  SLA is the custodian of State land and property:

(1) One of its key roles is to optimise land resources for Singapore’s economic and social development.

(2) SLA oversees the management of about 2,600 State properties in total.

(3) These include landed and non-landed residential properties, former schools, former army camps and shophouses, for example.

(4) Within this portfolio of properties are older, heritage bungalows, and this includes the Black and Whites.

(5) Some Black and Whites are also gazetted as Conservation properties under the Planning Act, and consequently, carry the obligations which are imposed on Conservation Properties.&nbsp; There are other properties which are accorded “protected” status, whilst they are evaluated for conservation.

(6) No. 26 and 31 Ridout Road were designated on 29 November 1991 as Conservation Properties (and they were subsequently gazetted in 1992), as they are two rare and intact remaining historic bungalows built in the early 1900s, whose outstanding architectural quality represents the culture and lifestyle of a period in Singapore’s history.

*URA’s requirements of conservation and protection*
    
{:start="10"}
10.  Ms He Ting Ru had asked about parameters and guidelines for the grant of conservation status. As Singapore’s conservation authority, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is mandated to identify for protection and conservation properties in Singapore which are of heritage value.
 
{:start="11"}
11.  URA conserves various categories of pre-war bungalows, amongst which the Black and Whites is one category.&nbsp; These are characterised by a particular architectural style from the early 1900s and are visibly recognisable by the black timber structural frame with white infill plastered walls.&nbsp; Hipped tiled roofs with wide overhangs and extensive verandas are also common features.
    
{:start="12"}
12. These bungalows are a part of Singapore’s history.

(1) Some are located in areas where the British naval and air bases used to be:&nbsp;&nbsp;
		a. For example, Sembawang and Seletar.
    
{:start="13"}
13.  At present, there are 36 conserved Black and Whites, and a further 235 State-owned Black and Whites are marked for study for conservation and hence in the meantime, they are protected.
 
{:start="14"}
14. Both categories, whether conserved or protected, impose obligations on the property owner, such as respecting the key elements of the bungalows in the use of the bungalow – namely, the roofs, the structural members, facades of the building, doors and windows and significant interior features including staircases, decorative mouldings, double volume spaces.
    
{:start="15"}
15.  In assessing No. 26 and 31 Ridout Road for conservation, URA took into account the following:

(1) First, these are two intact remaining historic bungalows built in the early 1900s.

(2) Second, they are good examples of the “Black and White” architectural style which had been built by the Public Works Department of the colonial British government, which was responsible for building infrastructure – such as roads, bridges, irrigation works, reservoirs and so on – as well as providing accommodation for Government servants who oversaw such works.

*Development Plans for heritage bungalows*

{:start="16"}
16.  In managing the older, heritage properties, SLA aims to optimise their usage.&nbsp; At the same time, however, SLA also has to be responsible and mindful of maintaining these properties to meet their conservation and protection status:

(1) These bungalows were built around the early 1900s, and so are about 100 years old today, maintained in their original condition.

(2) They are located in a wide range of neighbourhoods, both in the central as well as in other areas.

(3) Some of them are found in dedicated estates for Black and Whites (for example: Malcolm Road)

(4) Others are interspersed with other private residential properties that are non-Black and Whites – for example, in the Ridout Road Estate.

{:start="17"}
17.  The development plans for these properties are ultimately guided by a few factors.
    
{:start="18"}
18.  We must first have regard to URA’s Master Plan which takes into account the intrinsic heritage value of the properties, amongst other factors:

(1) Specifically, the planning parameters assigned to areas with Black and Whites, are important considerations.

(2) The planning parameters determine how such land can be used, and for what purpose:

		a. For example, whether it can sustain high intensity development (such as high-rise buildings, commercial developments and so on).
		b. Or alternatively, whether it is zoned only for low intensity, landed properties only.

(3) Where possible, we will also consider if these properties can be modified for other uses or be integrated as part of new developments, with a view to rejuvenating and revitalising the area. This allows for modernisation of the estate while preserving the property’s core heritage value.

(4) In addition, we also take into account that these properties, which are dated to begin with, will require more maintenance and upkeep, and this will cost more.
   
{:start="19"}
19.  Second, these lands are part of our reserves:
 
(1) Singapore’s overall portfolio of State assets comprises financial and physical assets.

(2) Our physical assets include State lands.

(3) The State should be able to keep land parcels, as a block, where appropriate. This will give URA sufficient planning latitude.

(4) So these are the considered decisions that take into account a balance of factors, including the URA Masterplan.
    
{:start="20"}
20.  Specifically, for a heritage bungalow, there is the building itself – which has heritage and historical value.
     
{:start="21"}
21.  There is also the land on which the building sits and the areas adjacent to the building.&nbsp; How this land is utilised is also considered in the context of the URA Masterplan, which sets out a suite of planning parameters to guide our land use to meet our nation’s needs.&nbsp; In addition to preserving land, which is part of our reserves, we also manage the land use to cater to Singapore’s land needs in areas such as housing, education, and commercial uses.
    
{:start="22"}
22.  Accordingly, over time, SLA has carefully broadened the usage and deployment of these properties to meet the evolving needs of Singapore. A judicious balance is necessary, particularly between protecting heritage properties in Singapore and redeveloping them altogether.
   
{:start="23"}
23.  Hence, while we continue to retain some of the heritage bungalows for their original residential use on the rental market, some others have been demolished as a cluster to make way for newer developments. Others have been re-purposed for different uses, such as commercial and retail spaces or for example, F&amp;B.
 
{:start="24"}
24.  With these parameters in mind, the Government has sought to re-purpose our heritage bungalows for various alternative uses.
    
{:start="25"}
25. And I thought it would be illustrative for me to cite some examples in this House for Members to appreciate:
    
(1) At the Gallop Extension to the Singapore Botanic Gardens, the bungalow at 5 Gallop Road has been repurposed as a Forest Discovery Centre. This is a public space, and serves as a picturesque backdrop to popular picnic grounds for the public. I’m sure some members, have visited the Centre.

(2) A standalone Black and White at Bah Soon Pah Road, which used to house an executive of a rubber estate, is under study to be conserved and integrated within a new HDB residential area. This was reported in the media in August 2022.

(3) Rochester Park and Nepal Park were developed by the British in the early 1950s to house officers and their families:
    
		a. The area was given conservation status in 2010. 12 conserved bungalows at Rochester Park have been put to new uses at Rochester Commons – a new integrated campus-style development in one-north by CapitaLand. And on this location, SLA also works with private sector partners, to develop the space, and to place-make Rochester Commons.
		b. Standing on a 2.4ha site, the mixed development will have an office tower, hotel, as well as 12 conserved bungalows which are retained in its form, the bungalows itself, with F&amp;B and office uses.
		
(4) Such heritage properties are not only being used for purely commercial purposes. For instance, bungalows have been also converted to kindergartens and also in some cases, serves as a shelter for women undergoing unsupported pregnancies. So we look at a broad range of uses, F&amp;B, commercial, and in some cases, social as well.

(5) In other cases, where possible, bearing in mind the circumstances and the location in the Masterplan, a larger site comprising more properties might well be suitable for a wider scale redevelopment:

		a. For instance, a cluster of 174 Black and Whites in Seletar Camp were previously demolished to make way for an industrial park.
	
(6) As I said, one has to bear in mind the specific context in which the estate is found, and also the Master Plan. If the Black and Whites are located amidst or amongst a landed enclave, such as in Ridout Road or perhaps Nassim Road, an area that is zoned for landed properties, removing the Black and Whites, or redeveloping them and the land around it, will not change the area much:

		a. The cleared land can only then be similarly used for low intensity development.
		b. It would not be possible to put the site to other uses, for example, some of those examples and occasions which I cited earlier.
	
{:start="26"}
26.  Accordingly, to Mr Gerald Giam’s and Ms He Ting Ru’s questions about the Government’s development plans for Black and Whites:

(1) These plans are driven by master-planning considerations.

(2) Taking into account specific circumstances of each set of properties where they are located, but also bearing in mind the intrinsic heritage value, and the possible uses that might be made of not just the building, but of the location and the site.

(3) One also has to be sensitive to the surrounding vicinity. As I mentioned, you cannot intersperse commercial activities amidst low-intensity housing developments.

(4) And within that entire framework, SLA seeks to optimise social outcomes and occupancy, and ultimately, to generate revenue where possible.

{:start="27"}
27.  These plans also seek to strike a balance between the preservation of heritage and the need to reallocate land for other uses.

{:start="28"}
28.  Another related question raised is: why not break down a large plot of land and sell it in smaller parcels?

(1) Singapore’s approach to land sales is primarily based on planning and development needs, and not mainly to maximise land sales proceeds.

(2) This is a considered decision that takes into account various factors.

(3) URA, through the Master Plan, assesses the best uses of the land, in the overall context of land allocation in Singapore.

(4) The planning considerations I have spent some time outlining are also relevant.&nbsp; It is not always tenable to break up land into smaller parcels, situated side by side but then each having a different land use. It will not place-make and in some cases, the uses may conflict with one another.

(5) In addition, the State should be able to keep land parcels as a block, where appropriate, as part of its land bank. This gives URA maximum planning latitude when it comes to future masterplans.

*Maintenance and upkeep of conserved Black and Whites*
    
{:start="29"}
29.  Mr Leong Mun Wai and Mr Leon Perera asked about the maintenance of Black and Whites.&nbsp; As I have explained above, a portfolio of such Black and Whites are kept as residential housing. They are leased out, they are not sold, on a rental basis. They are also subject to conservation and protection requirements.
    
{:start="30"}
30.  I would add that, particularly for conserved Black and Whites, and those which are protected whilst being studied for conservation, SLA invests a significant amount in upkeeping and maintaining the properties.
    
{:start="31"}
31.  A key reason for the cost is the nature of the conservation requirements for such properties:

(1) They are much older than the average property in Singapore, and require a lot more care, by way of renovation and maintenance.

(2) This is consistent with other similar conserved buildings in Singapore which have to comply with the relevant guidelines imposed on them as a result of either their conservation or their protected status.
    
{:start="32"}
32.  The requirements to maintain a conservation property apply to many aspects of the property and are very specific:

(1) For example, the guidelines will spell out the restoration requirements for the conserved building, and the alteration works that can be considered.

(2) And the interfacing zone between the conserved building and the new additions, if any, around the area.

{:start="33}
33  The restoration guidelines will specify details such as the design, location and material that can be used for all key elements such as the Roofs, Building Facades, Outhouse, Floors, Staircases, Internal Finishes, Building Colours and even in the context of air-conditioning and exhaust fans:

(1) Renovation and refurbishment of a conserved residential property put up for rent is thus not just to ensure that it is in a tenantable condition, but also to comply with the relevant guidelines which protect the heritage value of the property.

(2) When renovating a conserved or protected building, there is significant prescription on how the works and renovations are to be done.

(3) Features such as the beams and roof of the property must remain unaffected to the extent that they reflect the architectural value of the property, which was the reason it was identified for conservation in the first place.

*Limitations on upgrading Black and White*
    
{:start="34"}
34.  Besides the renovations required under conservation obligations, the interior and facilities of most Black and Whites also require upgrading.
    
{:start="35"}
35.  Many Black and Whites are more than a hundred years old.
    
{:start="36"}
36.  And they are not like modern detached houses. Most Black and Whites lack modern amenities which we often taken for granted, and require significant effort to retrofit:

(1) For example, some may lack air-conditioning, water heaters or even cooking hobs.
    
{:start="37"}
37.  Members have seen pictures of some Black and Whites over the last couple of weeks in the press:

(1) And you will see that the condition of these properties prior to tenancy, especially if they have been vacant for prolonged periods, is fairly obvious from the pictures.
    
{:start="38"}
38.  Therefore, quite often, incoming tenants have to undertake capital expenditure to upgrade the unit to raise it to modern standards.

(1) But the conservation requirements that I just outlined, often impose constraints on how far a tenant can retrofit the properties in question.
    
{:start="39"}
39.  Also, unlike owners of a property, tenants can only enjoy the benefits of retrofitting for the duration of the tenancy:

(1) It is a standard term in such leases that when the tenancy lapses, the property, and everything that is upgraded by the tenant at his cost, will be returned to SLA, if SLA wishes to keep the upgrade. This clause also appears in the tenancies of both No. 26 and 31 Ridout Road.

(2) In such cases, there is therefore a need to find a tenant prepared to:

		a. Invest capital to upgrade the unit to meet modern day amenities.
		b. Accept that the benefits of investment can only be enjoyed for the duration of the tenancy.
		c. And take on the risk of a higher rental price to renew, or not renewing and writing off the cost of the capital expenditure altogether.
			
{:start="40"}
40.  This limits the pool of prospective tenants for Black and Whites:

(1) Most tenants would prefer a ready-to move in property:

		a. Which they can furnish and almost immediately occupy.
		
(2) And not have to fork out capital expenditure.
     
{:start="41"}
41.  To address this challenge, SLA has been adjusting the structure of tenancies to provide more flexibility:

(1) For example, in suitable cases, where tenants are prepared to commit larger sums of capital expenditure to enhance the properties, SLA has been prepared to grant tenancies of 5+4 years, instead of&nbsp; 3+3+3 years so that there is a longer lead time in the initial tenancy period to recover the amortized costs of the capital expenditure.

(2) This ties in with the larger goal of maximising occupancy while ensuring that the tenants are able to keep up and maintain the properties, and, where possible, also enhance and add to the property through the tenants’ capital expenditure.

(3) In addition, SLA is also studying the feasibility of extending even longer leasehold periods (e.g., 30 or 60 years) in an estate en\-bloc so that a private developer can come in as the master-leaseholder and rejuvenate the entire estate and be able to upkeep the properties in the meantime, as well as reap the benefits over the longer lease period.

{:start="42"}
42.  These are various measures which SLA is taking, amongst others, to manage the category of bungalows that are within its management portfolio to maximise the opportunities for the State to benefit from these properties.
    
*Rental benchmark against the private residential market*
		
{:start="43"}
43.  Mr Don Wee had asked about the rental rate of State-owned heritage properties benchmarked against the private residential market.
    
{:start="44"}
44.  Sir, the valuation of residential Black and White properties for rental is dependent on various factors:

(1) First, the Gross Floor Area (“GFA”) is the guiding component in determining the rent:

		a. GFA represents the available live-in space for the tenant.
		
(2) As between GFA and land area, the former usually has a larger impact on the marketability of the property.

(3) Other factors, such as condition of the property and location are also relevant.
    
{:start="45"}
45.  In his report, SM Teo has set out the comparable rental and occupancy rates for both State-owned Black and Whites as well as private properties.
    
{:start="46"}
46.  The following additional points can also be gleaned:

(1) Rental trends of Black and Whites tend to follow the general rental market trends.&nbsp; For the relevant period in 2017-2019, market conditions were weak and generally on a downward trajectory.

(2) This is evident from URA’s rental index for landed properties which showed a consistent softening of the rental market from 2015 to 2020.

(3) The demand for leasing generally, and Black and Whites specifically, was much lower at that time, in the period 2017 to 2019, compared to today. The occupancy rates of State properties have generally moved in tandem with market conditions.

(4) Rents of private detached homes and Black and Whites typically trended in the same direction from 2012 to 2019, though the former plunged more severely from 2020 to Q32022 and recovered more aggressively from late 2022 to 2023.
    
{:start="47"}
47.  The court’s powers under the new section 11C will complement its existing powers under the Evidence Act to, among others, forbid any question which appears to the court to be intended to insult or annoy or appears to be needlessly offensive.
    
**New section 46(ha) of the Women’s Charter - The FJR may set out the modes by which a child’s wishes may be determined by the court**
    
{:start="48"}
48.  The third key provision in the Bill provides that the FJR may set out the modes by which the wishes of a child may be determined by the court. The intention is for the prescribed modes to expressly include interviews conducted by a judge with a child, in addition to the variety of other methods which may be used to hear a child’s voice such as through the Child Representatives or an assessment by a mental health professional.
    
{:start="49"}
49.  In the context of matrimonial proceedings under the Women’s Charter, section 125 of the Women’s Charter provides that in deciding in whose custody a child should be placed, the paramount consideration shall be the welfare of the child.
    
{:start="50"}
50.  Section 125 also specifically requires the court to have regard to:
    
(a) The wishes of the parents; and
    
(b) The wishes of a child where he or she is of an age to express an independent opinion.
    
{:start="51"}
51.  However, section 125 does not provide for the modes by which the child’s wishes may be determined.
    
{:start="52"}
52.  The RERF Committee, in its report, discussed the benefits of judges conducting interviews with children and noted that in Singapore, there have been cases where judges have conducted interviews with children to reach outcomes that serve the interests of the child.
    
{:start="53"}
53.  An example of such a case is AZB v AZC \[2016\] SGHCF 1. In that case:
    
(a) The High Court Judge interviewed three children between the ages of 11 to 13 in a dispute between their parents on care and control and access arrangements.
    
(b) The Judge noted that:
 
* There were indications that the children wished to speak with her;
 
* The children were mature enough to express their views on matters that impacted their lives.
 
(c) In deciding that it would be in the children’s welfare to increase the access time with their mother, the Judge relied on, among other things, the Judge’s conversations with the children which corroborated the finding that the children enjoyed access time with their mother.
    
{:start="54"}
54.  The Committee mentioned that there has been research highlighting children’s wishes to be more involved in the decisions that may affect their lives profoundly, and their dissatisfaction with the indirect processes that are available to them.
    
{:start="55"}
55.  The Committee recommended therefore that it should be made clear that the judge-led approach allows for a judge to interview a child.
    
{:start="56"}
56.  It should be noted that each case is unique, with different considerations applying to each family and each child. It is not in every case that a judicial interview of children is suitable. In some cases, the court may assess that it would be more appropriate to appoint a Child Representative, who is a trained professional appointed by the court to represent the voice of a child and present an objective assessment of care arrangements which are in the child’s best interest, or other professional, to hear from the child.
    
**SIMPLIFYING COURT TERMINOLOGY**
    
{:start="57"}
57.  Moving on to the next bucket of reforms, the Bill will amend various pieces of legislation to modernise and simplify nomenclature for family proceedings.
    
{:start="58"}
58.  For example:
    
(a) “Plaintiff” will be replaced by “Applicant”;
 
(b) “Defendant” will be replaced by “Respondent”; and
 
(c) “Writ for divorce” will be replaced by “originating application for divorce”.
    
{:start="59"}
59.  This will be in line with the amendments made to court terminology in civil court proceedings under the Courts (Civil and Criminal Justice) Reform Act 2021 and the Rules of Court 2021.
    
{:start="60"}
60.  In the new Family Justice Rules to be introduced, the simplified terminology will also be adopted. These changes will make it easier for court users and members of the public to understand family proceedings.
    
{:start="61"}
61.  This will amplify the existing efforts by the Government and Judiciary to enhance access to justice, especially for persons who cannot afford legal representation, by simplifying court processes.
    
**MISCELLANEOUS AND TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS**
    
{:start="62"}
62.  The last bucket of reforms relates to various miscellaneous and technical amendments to clarify, enhance and streamline processes in the FJC.
    
{:start="63"}
63.  I will elaborate on two of the amendments.
    
{:start="64"}
64.  First, on mediation and other alternative dispute resolution process or “ADR process” for short:
    
(a) Currently, the Family Justice Act provides that a Family Court or Youth Court, respectively, may, on its own motion or upon the application of any party, order any party or any child who is the subject of proceedings, to undergo mediation or counselling, or to participate in any family support programme or activity.
 
(b) The court also has powers to order a party or child to undergo other ADR processes, or to attend professional clinical or therapeutic intervention sessions. The Bill will clarify in the FJA that a Family Court or Youth Court has such powers.
    
(c) The Bill will also clarify in legislation the existing powers of the Court to appoint Judicial officers, officers of the FJC or any other persons (such as volunteer lawyers), to conduct mediations or other ADR processes.
    
(d) Amendments will also be made to provide that a Family Court or Youth Court may make the appropriate and necessary orders where a person fails to comply with the court’s orders to attend mediation or other ADR process, such as an order staying proceedings until the orders are complied with.
    
{:start="65"}
65.  Second, the Bill will adopt section 43 of the State Courts Act which applies to a District Court, by expressly providing that the Family Court may order that a judgment sum be paid in a lump sum or by instalments, and may order that a judgment be suspended or stayed if the judgment debtor is unable to pay the sum.
    
(a) The amendments will align the position under the FJA with that in section 43 of the State Courts Act.
 
(b) Depending on the circumstances of the case, in certain situations, instead of incurring time and costs in enforcement or bankruptcy proceedings, it may be more sensible, and in the interests of both parties, for the court to grant a short reprieve to the judgment debtor, or to allow the judgment debtor to pay the judgment creditor by way of instalments. This is especially important in family proceedings where further litigation would put an additional strain on the fractured relationship, and adversely impact children involved in the proceedings.
    
{:start="66"}
66.  I will not go into details on all the other amendments under the Bill, but members are free to raise any questions that they may have on those amendments.
    
**CONCLUSION**
    
{:start="67"}
67.  To conclude, I would like to express our gratitude to the members of the RERF Committee for their recommendations, and the stakeholders and members of the public who have taken the time to give us feedback on the family justice system.
    
{:start="68"}
68.  With your feedback and suggestions, we were better able to shape the reforms in this Bill to resolve the real issues faced by families and children in family proceedings and to better protect, restore and heal families and children.
    
{:start="69"}
69.  Time will be required, and work will need to be put in to operationalize some of the changes in this Bill, including the Maintenance Enforcement Process.
