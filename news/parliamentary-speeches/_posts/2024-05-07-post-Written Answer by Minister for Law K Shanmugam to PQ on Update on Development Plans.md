<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Member of Parliament for Mountbatten SM)</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law (a) whether development plans for the Marina Bay Golf Course have been finalised; and (b) if not, whether SLA will consider offering an extension of its lease until development plans for the land site are finalised and the site is required for further development.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	We had announced in 2014 that the lease for the Marina Bay Golf Course will not be renewed after its expiry in July this year, as the site will be redeveloped.

{:start="2"}
2. The land at the Marina Bay Golf Course site is required for various uses, including the development of the expanded Bay East Garden and Foundersâ€™ Memorial. Construction at the site is expected to commence shortly after the site is returned to the State.

{:start="3"}
3. SLA is therefore unable to grant any extension to the lease of the Marina Bay Golf Course.
