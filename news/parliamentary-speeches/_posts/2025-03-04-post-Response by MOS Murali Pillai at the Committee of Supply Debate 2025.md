{:start="1"}
1. Sir, I would like to start off by adding my appreciation to honourable members for their cuts, as well as their speeches in this debate. I would cover three broad areas: first, the prudent and imaginative use of state assets, second, safeguarding our society from concerns posed by emerging technologies, and third, access to justice.

<b><u>I. STATE ASSETS AND HARNESSING TECHNOLOGY</u></b>

**A. Prudent and Imaginative Use of State properties to support multi-generational living and community hubs**

{:start="2"}
2. The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) ensures effective and imaginative use of land resources.

{:start="3"}
3. To address Mr Zhulkarnain’s and Ms Nadia Samdin’s queries, this is done by cultivating a good understanding of social and community needs through proactive engagement:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) For example, SLA engages the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre and community entities such as New Hope, to understand their challenges in finding suitable spaces.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Through such engagements, SLA identified emerging demands such as silver co-living and the need for community spaces.</p>

{:start="4"}
4. First, to address rising demand for independent living for older Singaporeans,

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) SLA activated State properties such as 79 to 95 Hindoo Road, 26 Evans Road, and 98 Henderson Road.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Building on the response, SLA plans to launch a tender in the first quarter of this year for 20 heritage properties at Admiralty Road East for multi-generational co-living. Proposals with holistic programming and emphasis on inter-generational co-living that encourages independent senior living will be favourably considered.</p>

{:start="5"}
5. Second, SLA is activating State properties with potential to bring communities together.

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) One example is the transformation of 30 Maxwell Road into a wellness and fitness hub through the joint initiative with URA, Reinventing Spaces into Vibrant Places, as noted by Mr Keith Chua.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Another example is the transformation of the former Elections Department office at 11 Prinsep Street into a social impact hub named The Foundry, which started operations last year.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) Further, SLA will restore and repurpose Block 1 East Coast Road (1ECR) for community and social uses. The renovated space will provide programs and training to support youth, as well as recreational activities for all ages. SLA called a tender for a multi-disciplinary team of consultants in September 2024 to provide consultancy services for Additions &amp; Alterations (A&amp;A) works – with estimated completion in 2028.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(d) SLA will continue collaborating with agencies to introduce more State properties for economic and social uses. By launching more Price-Quality tenders, SLA will be able to better curate placemaking efforts to benefit the community.</p>

**B. Updates on the Digital Conveyancing Portal (DCP)**

{:start="6"}
6. Besides optimising the use of State assets, we are harnessing technology to digitalise transactions.

{:start="7"}
7.  Singapore's current conveyancing system is reliant on physical documents and processes, and requires significant manpower.

{:start="8"}
8. SLA has therefore been developing the Digital Conveyancing Portal (DCP). It is a fully integrated, digital end-to-end conveyancing process for all types of property: from the stage of Option to Purchase (OTP) to Legal Completion. It will also enable e-payments and digital documents.

{:start="9"}
9. When operationalised, the DCP will provide greater convenience to all parties, including buyers and sellers, law firms, real estate professionals, financial institutions, and developers.

{:start="10"}
10. We are testing the system rigorously and seeking industry feedback, including on how the phases of the DCP should be prioritised and the continuing evolution of associated technology.

{:start="11"}
11. The first phase of the DCP focuses on private residential resale transactions, which make up more than half of private real estate transactions. Beta testing of the OTP process started in November 2024 with selected stakeholders. Live OTP transactions for the private residential resale market is targeted to commence, as a pilot initially, in 2025.

{:start="12"}
12. The DCP functions and types of transactions will be progressively expanded in subsequent phases.

<b><u>II. DEVELOPING NEW MEASURES TO BENEFIT FROM EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES WHILE ENSURING ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS</u></b>

**A. Maintaining a robust and balanced IP regime that supports creativity and innovation**

{:start="13"}
13. Even as technology becomes integral, we are aware that it also presents issues, particularly with copyright.

{:start="14"}
14. Our intellectual property (IP) regime incentivises the creation of new works by rewarding creators with a set of rights over the use of their works. At the same time, allows reasonable access to these works by third parties, including other creators and innovators who may build on them.

{:start="15"}
15. In this way, we maximise creative and innovative output through a balanced approach.

{:start="16"}
16. Ms Sylvia Lim, Ms Jean See asked about the balance in the context of AI.

{:start="17"}
17. While the IP regime enables the use of copyright materials for digital innovation, we have built in conditions to protect legitimate interests of rights-holders.

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) In particular, if copyright materials are used to train AI models, the materials must be lawfully accessed, for example, for materials behind paywalls, through paid access.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Furthermore, rights-holders can use the copyright protection regime to take action against the generation or use of content substantially similar to their own.</p>

{:start="18"}
18. We recognise technologies such as GenAI significantly impact many stakeholders.

{:start="19"}
19. The Government remains committed to working with the creative community to address their concerns.

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) There is ongoing engagement with stakeholders, including those in the creative sector such as writers, publishers, record labels and creative agencies.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">	
(b) Some of the suggestions received include:</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 70px">
(i) Greater transparency in how copyright material is used for AI training; and</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 70px">
(ii) For rights-holders to have more control over use of their material.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) We are studying these suggestions.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 70px">
(i) For example, we are exploring, with MDDI and IMDA, support for transparency measures and respect for copyright in our AI governance policies and tools;</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 70px">
(ii) such as IMDA’s upcoming safety guidelines for Generative AI model developers and app deployers.</p>

{:start="20"}
20. MinLaw and IPOS will continue to work with stakeholders to maintain the right balance that will support creativity and innovation.

**B. AI in Legaltech**
	
{:start="21"}
21. We are also focused on the impact of technology in the legal sector.

{:start="22"}
22. Legal professionals should use GenAI tools safely and responsibly, even as we encourage its adoption.

{:start="23"}
23. The need for guard-rails is clear, because:

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) One: GenAI may give inaccurate responses or hallucinate.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Two: Security and privacy concerns – some GenAI models may store user information and search history to train the model. This may then be reproduced for responses to other users.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) Three: Ethical concerns – with the rapid development of GenAI by different programmers, it is critical that GenAI tools are developed within a framework guided by principles, ethics and rules.</p>	
	
{:start="24"}
24. Considering this context, MinLaw is working on guidelines to guide legal professionals to be smart buyers and users of GenAI tools.

{:start="25"}
25. We have consulted stakeholders such as the Singapore Courts, Law Society and IMDA, and will consult the industry in due course.

<b><u>III. ENHANCING PROTECTIONS FOR THE VICTIMS OF ONLINE HARM</u></b>

{:start="26"}
26. Another facet of digitalisation is the emerging threats to users and our community.

{:start="27"}
27. Mr Lim Biow Chuan, Mr Vikram Nair, Mr Zhulkarnain and Ms Nadia Samdin asked about the Government’s efforts to combat online harms.

{:start="28"}
28. The Government has taken significant steps to address the prevalence of online harms. This includes, amongst others:

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) Enacting the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) in 2014 and strengthening it in 2019, to provide victims with legal recourse for harassment, including online harassment, and</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Enacting the Online Safety (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act and the Online Criminal Harms Act to allow the Government to act against harmful content.</p>	
	
{:start="29"}
29. However, online harms continue to be an area of concern for many, and Honourable Members said that in their speeches too.

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) A 2024 survey by MDDI found that two thirds of respondents encountered harmful content on social media.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Online harms are an especially serious problem for the young, and young women, in particular. In a 2023 study by SG Her Empowerment (SHE), more than half of respondents between 15 to 24 years old reported having personally experienced online abuse. This was more than in any other age group. And within this age group: young women were nearly twice as likely as men to be victims of sexual harassment. 40% of victims of online harassment reported suffering severe emotional and psychological distress, including depression, and self-harm.</p>
	
{:start="30"}
30. MinLaw and MDDI have been studying the gaps that remain. We have consulted extensively with community groups (such as those working with youths, and women and girls), experts, technology companies, and the Judiciary.

{:start="31"}
31. The key gaps identified are:

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">	
(a) The need for a simple and fast process to seek relief from online harms. The court process can be daunting and difficult to navigate.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Uncertainty over whether existing laws can be used to address new emerging harms, and</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) The lack of accountability as perpetrators are often anonymous.</p>

**New Agency to Act on Online Harms**
	
{:start="32"}
32. To address these gaps, MinLaw and MDDI are working together on new legislation that will cover three broad buckets:

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) First: It will establish a new agency that will quickly act on complaints of online harms. MDDI will share more details about the agency as well as some of its broader efforts to deal with online harms.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Second: It will set out Statutory Torts to clarify the types of online harms covered under the law, and the rights and duties of the various parties in the online ecosystem. These Statutory Torts will provide a clear legal basis for victims to hold to account those responsible for the harm they suffer. We intend the Statutory Torts to apply to a range of serious online harms, including online harassment, intimate image abuse, and child abuse material.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) Third, it will introduce new mechanisms to address the misuse of anonymity by perpetrators of online harms.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 70px">
(i) As Ms Nadia Samdin and others have rightly observed – there must be adequate information in the first place, if the intent is to enhance accountability.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 70px">
(ii) Victims may apply to find out a perpetrator’s user information. The victim may need to know, so as to:</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 85px">
1. consider legal proceedings.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 85px">
2. better protect himself or herself from the perpetrator.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 70px">
(iii) The provision of such information will be subject to safeguards, to prevent abuse. The information should not be used to carry out “counter-attacks”. Stakeholders, such as tech companies, have also expressed some reservations - mainly about how such measures will impact their business. We will work closely with them to mitigate their concerns. We will announce more details in due course.</p>

{:start="33"}
33. The Government is committed to ensuring that victims have accessible and effective remedies when they suffer online harms.

<b><u>IV. UPDATE ON THE PROTECTION FROM HARASSMENT COURT</u></b>

{:start="34"}
34. Mr Patrick Tay has asked for the figures relating to Protection from Harassment Court (PHC).

{:start="35"}
35. The number of applications for protection orders to the PHC since it started operations on 1 June 2021 are as follows.

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) 346 PO applications were filed in 2021;</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) 520 in 2022,</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) 526 in 2023; and</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(d) 631 in 2024.</p>

{:start="36"}
36. In terms of breakdown, out of the 2,023 PO applications filed from 1 June 2021, which is when the PHC commenced operations, to 31 December 2024, there were complaints about the following kinds of harassment:

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) 760 cases involving cyberbullying;</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) 719 involving doxing;</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) 485 involving workplace harassment;</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(d) 253 involving sexual harassment; and</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(e) 122 cases involving harassment by debt collectors, moneylenders or creditors.</p>
	
{:start="37"}
37. The total number is 2,339 though there were 2,023 applications. This is because a single application can contain complaints for more than one type of harassment.

<b><u>V. IMPLEMENTATION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CODE RELATING TO PERSONAL BOND</u></b>
	
{:start="38"}
38. I now turn to Ms Sylvia Lim’s query on the personal bond in criminal cases – an amendment in the Criminal Procedure (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 2024.

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) This allows persons accused of non-bailable offences punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment to be released on personal bond, as an alternative to bail.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Previously, persons accused of such offences could only be released on bail while awaiting investigations or trial. They would be remanded if they are unable to find a bailor, even though they are offered bail.</p>

{:start="39"}
39. With this amendment, they may be released by putting up a bond by themselves in appropriate cases. This reduces the disruptions to their lives and earning capacity, as mentioned by the Honourable Member.

{:start="40"}
40. Since the amendment was implemented in August 2024, more than 100 accused persons have been released on personal bond for non-bailable offences.

{:start="41"}
41. The personal bond regime is new and is in infancy. We will continue to keep our policies on remand and bail under review.

<b><u>VI. IMPROVING LEGAL PROCESSES FOR SINGAPOREANS</u></b>
	
**A. Access to Justice and the Digital Divide**
	
{:start="42"}
42. Lastly, I turn to our work on: Ensuring access to justice.

{:start="43"}
43. The Honourable Second Minister for Law Mr Edwin Tong mentioned about the good work of the Public Defender’s Office and the Legal Aid Bureau.

{:start="44"}
44. MinLaw is also working with various partners to increase access to justice, including through technology.
	
{:start="45"}
45. Notably, we have collaborated with Pro Bono SG (PBSG) to develop LawGoWhere. Launched in March last year, this is a first-stop portal that consolidates access to legal information, legal services and law awareness resources. This year, a legal help finder will be integrated, to make it easier for users to seek legal information. Users may key in information such as their postal code and legal issue, and receive legal assistance options, such as their nearest legal clinics.

{:start="46"}
46. Even as the use of technology increases, we are mindful of the digital divide, a point that Dr Tan Wu Meng made.

{:start="47"}
47. On his query, measures have been taken to ensure that justice remains accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of familiarity with technology. For example: Individuals who have difficulties with court e-services like CJTS, can contact the State Courts by calling their hotline. They may also visit the State Courts Business Centre to access digital terminals or approach the State Courts Service Hub if they require assistance.

**B. Other Law Reforms**
	
{:start="48"}
48. Before I conclude, Mr Chairman, I would like to thank Honourable Members for their comments.
	
{:start="49"}
49. Ms Usha Chandradas spoke about possible areas for law reform. Given the full slate of work outlined, some of these reviews will require more time for careful consideration. I understand from MSF that the same also applies to the 2000 Protection of Adults Convention.
	
{:start="50"}
50. Prof Razwana also spoke about recidivism. This was covered by MHA in their COS.
	
<b><u>VII. CONCLUSION</u></b>

{:start="51"}
51. Mr Chairman Sir, in conclusion:

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) 2M spoke about the importance of the law and legal processes on achieving good outcomes for Singapore – underpinned by the rule of law.</p>
	
</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) He also spoke about our efforts and approach to growing the economy, even as Singapore faces challenges in this turbulent external environment. We will strengthen our legal framework to be business-friendly and forward-looking, especially in the areas of IP, dispute resolution and debt restructuring and insolvency.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) Furthermore, 2M outlined our moves to grow the capabilities of law firms and legal professionals – through adoption of LegalTech, facilitating access to overseas markets and uplifting all areas of the profession to grow new competencies.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(d) Then, he spoke about Enforcement Mechanisms in Family Justice and Civil Enforcement; as well as helping the most vulnerable in our society access the legal system. He also provided an update on the Community Disputes Management Framework.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(e) Lastly, he announced our celebration of the 200th anniversary of the establishment of Singapore’s modern legal system.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 40px">
(f) I have covered SLA’s efforts to optimise the use of State assets to meet changing needs and developments on the Digital Conveyancing Portal; our efforts to maintain a robust and balanced IP regime that supports creativity and innovation, as well as ensuring that the legal profession uses GenAI safely and responsibly; new legislation to enhance protection for the vulnerable online; updates on the Protection from Harassment Court; implementation of reforms on Personal Bond; and leveraging technology for access to justice while preventing a digital divide.</p>

{:start="52"}
52. Together, these form the foundations of our shared public life. Laws are made together, and made legitimate, in this House, but it is only in the living and working out of these rules, that we as a country, give them life. Thank you.
