**Mr Vikram Nair (Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC)**

<b><u>Question</u></b>

To ask the Minister for Law whether he can elaborate on the concept of “indivisible security” as referenced in his speech entitled “The Russia-Ukraine War and Southeast Asia One Year On: Implications and Outlook” that was delivered on 8 March 2023 at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute workshop.

<b><u>Oral Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will first start with the point of Sovereignty.

{:start="2"}

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-determination, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the non-recourse to use of force are fundamental principles of international law.

{:start="3"}

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These principles are enshrined in the UN Charter.

{:start="4"}

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 193 States are party to the Charter, including Singapore.

a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Article 1(2)</u> of the UN Charter states that one of the UN’s purposes is “[t]o develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace”.

b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Article 2(1)</u> provides that the UN is “based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members”.

c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Article 2(4)</u> provides that all Members “shall refrain in their international relations – from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state …”.

d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Article 2(7)</u> provides that “[n]othing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the [UN] to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state”.

{:start="5"}

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russia’s invasion of Ukraine violates these basic principles of international law – including self-determination, sovereignty, territorial integrity and the non-recourse to use of force.

{:start="6"}

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my speech that Mr Vikram Nair referred to, I think I said 4 times that the Russian invasion cannot be justified.

{:start="7"}

7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russia has invoked Indivisible Security as among the reasons for the invasion of Ukraine. And as I have said, Indivisible Security cannot give grounds for the Russian invasion.

{:start="8"}

8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indivisible Security is not of the same status as self-determination, sovereignty, or territorial integrity and the non-recourse to use of force.

{:start="9"}

9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indivisible Security is, I think, best characterised as a concept that is invoked in international relations.

{:start="10"}

10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I pointed out that the concept of Indivisible Security, in some form, has been invoked by both Russia and the United States.

{:start="11"}

11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that does not make it a principle of international law. And it is not set out in the UN Charter.

{:start="12"}

12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, in my speech, I shared diverse views on how the situation in Ukraine unfolded, and the roles of the West, NATO, and the Russian Federation.

{:start="13"}

13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The result is that Ukraine is the unfortunate victim, and its people are paying a terrible price.
