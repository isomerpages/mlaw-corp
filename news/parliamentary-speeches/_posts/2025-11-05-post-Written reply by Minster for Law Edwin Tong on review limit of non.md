<b><u>Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament</u></b><br>
<b>Ms Valerie Lee (Member for Parliament for Pasir Ris-Changi GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b><br>
To ask the Minister for Law whether the current limit of 18 non-training days during the Practice Training Period for trainee lawyers remains appropriate; (b) what measures the Ministry intends to take against law firms that impose stricter limits; and (c) whether the Ministry will consider reviewing or increasing the permissible absence limit to better align with practices in other Commonwealth jurisdictions.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b><br>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;The Practice Training Framework was introduced in 2024, following deliberations by the Working Group for the Implementation of the Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers’ Recommendations (CPTL WG). The CPTL WG had decided based on industry norms and considering exigencies such as illness or family commitments, that it would be reasonable to allow for 18 non-training days as the benchmark for trainees undergoing the 12-month  training period (PTP).

2.&nbsp;The practice training framework and its requirements are administered by the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE), in consultation with the Ministry of Law (MinLaw). SILE’s Practice Training Period Guidelines 2024, which are published on their website, permit a maximum of 18 non-training days. Trainees who require more 
than 18 non-training days can take additional time off, provided they make up the shortfall within 16 months from the start of their PTP. Prior to 2024, trainees had to make up any non-training days during the PTP itself.

3.&nbsp;It is nonetheless open for the number of leave days in a training contract to be agreed between a trainee and the supervising law practice. Further, trainees intending to take more non-training days than the allowance provided in their training contracts can discuss alternative arrangements with the supervising law practice, which has incentive to be reasonable in competing for trainees. This is generally aligned with the approach adopted in other jurisdictions.

4.&nbsp; As the framework was implemented only in 2024, MinLaw will continue to monitor its efficacy. The first batch of Lawyers (Non-Practitioner) were admitted to the Singapore Bar in April 2025 and will complete their PTP in 2026. We will take into account industry feedback to decide if further reviews are needed.
