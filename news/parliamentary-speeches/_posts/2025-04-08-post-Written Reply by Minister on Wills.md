<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>**Ms Hany Soh (Member of Parliament for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC)**</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br> To ask the Minister for Law (a) what is the current number of Singaporeans who have registered their wills with the Singapore Academy of Law; and (b) how the Government can further encourage more Singaporeans to make their wills.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	As at 1 April 2025, there are over 153,000 Will records deposited with the Singapore Academy of Law Wills Registry. Registration with the Wills Registry is voluntary. Doing so makes it easier to locate the Will when needed. But the validity of a testatorâ€™s Will does not depend on whether one has registered his or her Will with the Registry.

2.	The Government has embarked on a national legacy planning campaign, to encourage legacy planning as it would allow Singaporeans to plan ahead on how they would like to be cared for, or their assets to be distributed, in the event that they lose mental capacity or pass on, thus reducing uncertainty and disputes over their estate.

{:start="3"}
3.	This national campaign promotes, among many things, MyLegacy@LifeSG (<a href="https://mylegacy.life.gov.sg/">mylegacy.life.gov.sg</a>), a one-stop Government portal that provides citizens with information and services on legacy planning. This includes useful tips and facts on Will-making, and information to dispel common myths and misconceptions about Wills as well as how to make a Lasting Power of Attorney, Advance Care Plan, and CPF nomination. The campaign is jointly organised by the Agency for Integrated Care, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social and Family Development, Central Provident Fund Board, and ServiceSG from the Public Service Division.

4.	The Government will continue its efforts to raise awareness and encourage citizens to take action to plan for their legacies. For example, it will be organising a legacy planning event in July 2025, that will provide guidance and resources to help citizens begin their legacy planning journey. We also encourage Singaporeans to visit the My Legacy portal for more information on Will-making.

{:start="5"}
5. Beyond these efforts, my Ministry regularly conducts reviews of our laws, including legislation governing wills, to ensure that our legal system remains efficient and effective, and that justice continues to remain accessible. This includes ensuring that the Will-making process remains accessible to Singaporeans.
