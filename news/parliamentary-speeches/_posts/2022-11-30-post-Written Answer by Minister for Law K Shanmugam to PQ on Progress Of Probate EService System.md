**Mr Murali Pillai (Member of Parliament for Bukit Batok SMC)**

**<b><u>Question</u></b>** 
<br>To ask the Minister for Law whether he can provide an update on  the progress of the development of the Probate e-service system that was announced in  Parliament in March 2022.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>** 

{:start="1"} 
1.  The Family Justice Courts (FJC) have been working on a  probate e-service that will make the probate process easier and simpler, for applicants  with straightforward probate applications.

{:start="2"} 
2.  As announced in March 2022, key features of the probate e-service will include the  automatic population of data through integration with MyInfo, and the use of guided  questions. Applicants using the e-service will no longer need to file death certificates if  the relevant information can be obtained by the e-service directly from a government  agency. The FJC is also studying how the application process can be further streamlined,  including by reducing the number of steps that an applicant needs to take before the  relevant application is granted. The FJC will also explore whether digital signing  capabilities can be added, in future enhancements.

{:start="3"} 
3.  The FJC is engaging stakeholders, including members of the family Bar, on the  probate e-service, and will consider their feedback in the final design of the system. 

{:start="4"} 
4.  The FJC currently intends to launch the system in the first half of 2023, although this  is subject to developmental progress. The system will initially be used for straightforward  probate cases, with capacity progressively ramped up over time.
