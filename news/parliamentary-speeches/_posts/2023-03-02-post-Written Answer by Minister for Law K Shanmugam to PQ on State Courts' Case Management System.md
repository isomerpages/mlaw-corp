**Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Member of Parliament for Chua Chu Kang)**

**<b><u>Question</u></b>** 
<br>To ask the Minister for Law what is the cause behind the hardware failure which led to the breakdown of the State Courts' online case management system for more than two days and what are the steps taken to ensure that such issues do not recur again.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>** 

{:start="1"} 
1.  Based on the information provided by the State Courts, which manages the State Courtsâ€™ Integrated Case Management System (ICMS), the disruption to the ICMS in February 2023 was caused by a hardware failure at the centralised hosting centre for ICMS servers, which resulted in database errors. The database was eventually fully recovered, with no data loss.

{:start="2"} 
2.  The State Courts are still investigating the incident. Once investigations have been completed, the State Courts will take steps to address the root causes. The State Courts are also pursuing various improvements to minimise the risk of future disruptions.
