**Mr David Ong Kim Huat, Jurong GRC** 
<br>  
**<u>Question</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law what are the rules, regulations and conventions in deciding when a bankrupt can be considered for a discharge.

**<u>Written Answer</u>**  
1. There are two avenues through which a bankrupt may be discharged. First, the High Court may discharge a bankrupt by granting him an Order of Discharge, following an application made either by the bankrupt or the Official Assignee.



2. Second, the Official Assignee may discharge a bankrupt by issuing him a Certificate of Discharge, provided his proven debts do not exceed $500,000 and at least three years have lapsed since the commencement of his bankruptcy.



3. In deciding whether to grant a discharge to a bankrupt, the High Court and the Official Assignee take guidance from relevant case law that has examined the issue of discharge. Some of the factors that are considered include: the cause of the bankrupt’s insolvency and his culpability in incurring the debts; the bankrupt’s conduct prior to and during his bankruptcy; the contributions made by the bankrupt for the benefit of his creditors; and whether there are any objections by the creditors to the discharge.
