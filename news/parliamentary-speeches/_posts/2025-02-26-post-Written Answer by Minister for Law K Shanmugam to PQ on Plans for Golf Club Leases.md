<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>**Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member of Parliament)**</b>

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br> To ask the Minister for Law (a) whether new leases will be offered to the golf clubs whose leases expire before or in 2030; and (b) whether the land occupied by these golf clubs will be considered for competing land uses such as housing.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.	Agencies generally review the longer-term plans in respect of leases before the end of their term. The same applies to land leased to golf clubs. Such reviews will take into consideration the land needs for different uses (including need for golf) in Singapore.

{:start="2"}
2. Golf clubs, like other lessees, will be informed of the lease renewal decisions once reviews are done.
