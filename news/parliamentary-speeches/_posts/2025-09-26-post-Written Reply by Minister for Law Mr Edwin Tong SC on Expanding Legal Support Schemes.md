<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

**Mr Lee Hong Chuan (MP of Jurong East-Bukit Bakok GRC)** 

<b><u>Question:</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law whether the Ministry can consider expanding or introducing new legal support schemes specifically for citizens who do not qualify for existing pro bono legal services but face potential financial difficulties in obtaining legal representation for civil or family related matters.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Singapore, the strong partnership among the Government, the legal fraternity, and civil society is key to enhancing access to justice for vulnerable Singaporeans.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Legal Aid Bureau (LAB), under the Ministry of Law, provides legal aid to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, who satisfy a means test and a merits test. This legal aid covers civil matters, such as monetary claims, matrimonial and probate matters. The means test criteria were last updated in 2024, with an increase in the Per Capita Household Income and the Annual Value of the applicantâ€™s residence to $1,050 and $21,000 respectively. LAB will continue to exercise flexibility for deserving cases who may not meet the criteria at the margins. For instance, a Means Test Panel appointed by the Minister can recommend that aid be granted to an applicant who cannot afford basic legal services due to extenuating circumstances.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Individuals who are not eligible for Government legal aid schemes may seek legal advice at the Community Law Centres by Pro Bono SG (PBSG), as well as various legal clinics across Singapore. PBSG also runs schemes that provide legal representation to eligible applicants, such as the Family Justice Support Scheme for matrimonial issues and the Ad Hoc Pro Bono Scheme, which accepts referrals for needy and vulnerable individuals who do not qualify for other legal aid schemes but require legal help due to exceptional circumstances.
