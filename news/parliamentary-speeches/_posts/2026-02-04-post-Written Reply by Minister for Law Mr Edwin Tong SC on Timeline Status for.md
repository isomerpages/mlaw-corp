<b><u>Name and Constituency of Member of Parliament</u></b><br>
<b>Mr Abdul Muhaimin Abdul Malik (Member of Parliament for Sengkang GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b><br>
To ask the Minister for Law (a) whether the multi-agency task force to support persons with invisible disabilities in the justice system has been convened; (b) if not, what is the expected timeline for its formation; and (c) if it has been convened, when will the task force publish its findings and recommendations.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b><br>
{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;On 26 March 2025, the Ministry first announced its commitment to a taskforce to better support persons with “invisible disabilities” in the criminal justice system at the inaugural Access to Justice Symposium hosted by Pro Bono SG. The organising committee for the Symposium was led by Ms Peggy Yee, Managing Director of PYLegal LLC and advocate for persons with “invisible disabilities”.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;Since then, the Ministry has been working with Ms Yee and other key stakeholders and community partners on foundational steps for the taskforce’s work: bringing together representatives with the right expertise and experience, identifying the taskforce’s preliminary scope and the potential areas that it may study, and establishing the necessary administrative and support structures.

3.&nbsp;The formal launch of the Inclusive Justice Taskforce was announced on 8 January 2026.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;The taskforce is co-led by Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Social and Family Development Mr Eric Chua and Ms Yee.

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;It comprises a multi-disciplinary group of representatives from across the private and public sector, including lawyers, policymakers, law enforcement officers, social service professionals, healthcare experts, community partners and caregiver representatives.

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;It will examine how our society can better support individuals with disabilities and mental health conditions who are at risk of offending or may interact with Singapore’s criminal justice system, including accused persons, victims and witnesses. A thorough and consultative review process will be undertaken to ensure that the taskforce’s recommendations are well-considered and practical.

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;The taskforce has started its work and will provide an update on its progress or recommendations in due course.

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;The Ministry looks forward to the taskforce’s contributions as part of our ongoing commitment to strengthen our legal system and advance access to justice to all, including those who are vulnerable.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;This launch is the latest instalment in the Ministry’s extensive efforts to ensure that our legal system remains effective, accessible and inclusive. These include our efforts to make laws, legal processes and court procedures easier to understand and navigate, the provision of civil legal aid and criminal defence aid to lower-income beneficiaries by the Legal Aid Bureau and the Public Defender’s Office, and our partnerships with Pro Bono SG, the legal fraternity and social service agencies to provide more holistic socio-legal support to those in need.
