**Mr Leon Perera (Non-Constituency Member of Parliament)**

**<u>Question:</u>**

To ask the Minister for Law whether the Government will allow older residents at Lorong 3 Geylang whose home leases will expire in less than five years to extend their lease or provide rehousing assistance to this group of residents.


**<u>Answer:</u>**

1. There are 191 private terrace houses at Lorong 3 Geylang. They sit on land parcels that are on 60-year leases. The 60 years will expire on 31 December 2020.

2. On 20 June 2017, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) announced that the land occupied by these 191 private terrace houses will return to the State when the current leases expire. The land is slated for future public housing. As a general policy, leasehold land will return to the State when the lease expires. This allows the land to be rejuvenated to meet the new social and economic needs of Singaporeans.

3. The SLA is committed to helping owners, especially those still occupying their units, through the lease expiry process. Each owner has been assigned a dedicated SLA officer, who will help guide them through the process over the next three-and-a-half years.

4. On 20 June 2017, SLA officers went house to house to introduce the dedicated officers and hand out a set of Frequently Asked Questions. SLA has also scheduled a personal session with each household to directly answer their questions, and this will take place over the next two months. Owners who need help in the transition can approach their assigned officer.

5. Most of the current owners of the 191 units have moved out, and are letting out their units to foreign workers and other occupants who use them for religious activities. Based on agenciesâ€™ records, only 33 units are still occupied by their owners. They have various options, if they do not already have alternative housing. They can buy an HDB flat or private property, rent on the open market or live with their family members. For elderly owner-occupants, there are also existing schemes which will help them in their transition, including the short-lease 2-Room Flexi flats.

6. During the personal sessions with the owners, SLA will check with them on their relocation plans and explain the various options available for those who require rehousing. For those who plan to buy an HDB flat, SLA will liaise with HDB and help with their applications.

7. HDB plans to launch 14 Build-to-Order (BTO) exercises between now and December 2020. In addition, HDB will also launch during this period seven Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises, where the units are completed or near completion. Eligible households have many options and time to book an HDB flat before their leases expire, especially if they apply for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates.

8. For those who face financial difficulties and have no other housing options, SLA will work with HDB to help in their application for a public rental flat. There is sufficient time for the owners to apply for the public rental flat.

9. For the owners who face difficulty transitioning to public housing due to existing rules/ policies, they may let their dedicated SLA case officer know. HDB is prepared to exercise flexibility for Singaporean households who require assistance. They will not be left without options.
