<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b>

<b>Dr Charlene Chen (Member of Parliament for Tampines GRC)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b><br>
To ask the Minister for Law what assistance is available to families, particularly those facing financial hardship in cases where the next-of-kin are unable to manage essential matters on behalf of their loved ones due to the absence of a Lasting Power of Attorney.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start=“1”}
1.&nbsp;The Legal Aid Bureau (LAB), a department in the Ministry of Law, provides legal aid to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who satisfy a means test and a merits test. This legal aid covers civil matters including deputyship applications for cases where there is an absence of a Lasting Power of Attorney.

2.&nbsp;There are two types of deputyship applications: standard and simplified applications. For standard applications, LAB can provide legal representation to eligible applicants. For simplified applications, applicants can generally file the applications themselves using the Family Justice Courts’ iFAMs system. If necessary, LAB can assist eligible applicants who are not digitally savvy.

3.&nbsp;Individuals who are not eligible for Government legal aid schemes may seek legal advice at the Community Law Centres by Pro Bono SG (PBSG), as well as various legal clinics across Singapore.
