<li><u>INTRODUCTION</u></li>
</ol>

1. Beg to move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper for today: for Parliament to appoint a Select Committee, to examine and report on deliberate online falsehoods.

 
<ol start="2">
<li>  Sir, the deliberate spread of online falsehoods today is a serious problem around the world.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">You see the details in the Green Paper that has been filed.</li>
</ol>

 
{:start="3"}
3. It gives a framework for the Government’s reasons for bringing this Motion.

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
<li><u>SERIOUS THREATS POSED TO SINGAPORE</u></li>
</ol>



<ol start="4">
<li>Countries across the world have been the subject of organised, deliberate disinformation campaigns.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> Conducted both by state actors, targeted at destabilising other countries, and also non-state actors.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> They spread the falsehoods deliberately to both interfere with the democratic processes, within countries, and to also destabilise and undermine institutions, within a specific country.</li>
</ol>




<ol start="5">
<li> Most Members, if not all, will have come across these examples reported almost on a daily basis in the media.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">And the Green Paper sets out in a summary some of the more serious ones.</li>
</ol>


<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold;">
<li><u>  Why Singapore is highly susceptible</u></li>
</ol>

{:start="6"}
6. Why are we concerned? Because we are highly susceptible, and let me share three reasons.

<ol start="7">
<li>  First, the very high internet penetration in Singapore.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">More than 91% of Singaporean households have internet access.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">So it is easy to attack and spread falsehoods in Singapore.  We have seen it happening.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="8">
<li>Second, our diversity – as a multi-racial, multi-religious society. That makes it easy to exploit the fault-lines through falsehoods.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">You get completely fabricated stories spreading.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">For example, June of last year – that cat and dog meat were mixed into a marinade of satay in a Geylang bazaar.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">That’s a relatively minor example though it can make a lot of people very angry.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">  But you have more serious examples from other countries.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">You see some of them in the Green Paper.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">People can and have targeted specific sections of populations.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> They can target specific sections of our population – using falsehoods based on race, religion.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="9">
<li>  Third, our international position, both in this region and internationally, makes us an attractive target.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">We are a key strategic node; a key player in ASEAN.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">We are a trade hub, commercial hub, financial hub, for this entire region.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">  What we say on regional issues, international issues carries weight.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> So if we can be influenced and swayed, then foreign interests can be advanced through us.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="10">
<li>We have been the subject of foreign interference in the past. The Green Paper again sets those out. Those are the obvious, known examples.</li> 
<li style="list-style-type: none"> For example, a Malaysian politician financing a newspaper in Singapore which campaigns against National Service.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">You can’t get a more obvious example.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> Of course, technology has added a completely new dimension.  </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> Minister Yaacob will touch on the points relating to technology and how it has completely changed the landscape.</li> 
</ol>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: upper-alpha; font-weight:bold">
 <li><u>What can this do?</u></li>
</ol>

<ol start="11">
<li>Wide spreading of falsehoods can drown out the facts; can cause people to be disillusioned; can be manipulated to create rifts, and damage social cohesion.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">So the people who shout loudest and shout falsehoods, are those who will get hurt.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> Falsehoods, because they tend to be focused on playing to people’s feelings and getting them to be angry, by putting forward points which are completely fabricated.</li>
</ol>



<ol start="12">
<li>A very senior official in Sweden is reported by BBC to have said and this was reported last week. Disinformation, as a tool, as a campaign, in context of Sweden, has had effect.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">    It “<i>affect[s] [Sweden’s] fundamental values – freedom of speech, democracy and individual rights</i>.”</li>
</ol>

<ol start="13">
<li> We are no different from these other societies which have been targeted and affected.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> No reason to believe that we are immune.</li>
</ol>


<ol start="14">
<li>Ultimately – if left unchecked, such deliberate spread of online falsehoods can undermine trust in the country, in its institutions, in democracy, and affect social cohesion. </li> 
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><u>  WHY WE ARE APPOINTING A SELECT COMMITTEE</u></li>
</ol>

<ol start="15">
<li>So – Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, I’m asking Parliament to appoint a Select Committee,
to examine and report on:
<ol>
<li>  the causes, and consequences of Deliberate Online Falsehoods; and</li>
<li>the countermeasures that will be required to prevent and combat them in Singapore.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="16">
<li>Government has been studying this problem for a while. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="17">
<li> Select Committee can study the issue in-depth with a smaller group of MPs, and then present a report to Parliament.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">  It will be open to the Select Committee to decide whether to hold public hearings, whether to hear from witnesses.</li> 
<li style="list-style-type: none">  I think it would be useful, to do so.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="18">
<li>The process will allow for a formal dialogue with the selected groups. </li>
</ol>

<ol start="19">
<li>The Composition of the Select Committee – we suggest - a default position is for 10 members: </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"> 9 Government MPs, and 1 MP from the Opposition bench.</li> 
<li style="list-style-type: none">  But we propose replacing 1 of the Government MP with a NMP, to have more diversity.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">  So we will have:
<br>
8 Government MPs, 1 Opposition MP and 1 NMP.</li>
</ol>


<ol start="20">
<li>Terms of Reference have been broadly framed – intentionally - so the Select Committee will have to consider relevant views, options.</li> 
</ol>

<ol start="21">
<li>Sir, I ask that Select Committee be appointed, to:

<ul>
<li>examine this problem thoroughly;</li>
<li>consult as widely as possible; and</li>
<li> come up with countermeasures on how we can protect Singapore against this threat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

Mr Deputy Speaker Sir, I beg to move.
