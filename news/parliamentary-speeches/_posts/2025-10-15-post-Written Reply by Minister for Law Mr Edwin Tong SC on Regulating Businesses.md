<b><u>Question for Written Answer</u></b><br>
<b>Ms Hany Soh (Member of Parliament for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC) </b>

<b><u>Question</u></b><br>
To ask the Minister for Law (a) whether the Ministry is aware of businesses providing Will and Probate courses; and (b) whether the Ministry will consider regulating such businesses for the protection of the public and reputation of the legal profession.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b><br>
{:start=“1”}
1.&nbsp;The provision of wills and probate courses is not restricted to the legal profession.

{:start=“2”}
2.&nbsp;However, members of the public are reminded that, unless conducted by an advocate and solicitor, businesses which provide courses on wills, probate and estate planning cannot give legal advice and cannot provide the services of an advocate and solicitor. Any unauthorised person, who holds himself out as an advocate and solicitor, is potentially liable for a criminal offence under the Legal Profession Act.

{:start=“3”}
3.&nbsp;Members of the public should therefore research the background of the course provider before they sign up for a will and probate course, to ensure that they are satisfied as to the background and quality of the course provider. A person who has doubts about legal issues or who requires legal advice should engage an advocate and solicitor.

4.&nbsp;To assist Singaporeans with making a will, information about legacy planning can be found on the Government’s My Legacy @ LifeSG website.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
