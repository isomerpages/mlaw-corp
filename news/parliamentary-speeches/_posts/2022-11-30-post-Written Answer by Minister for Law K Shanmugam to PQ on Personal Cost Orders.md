**Mr Leon Perera (Member of Parliament for Aljunied)**

**<b><u>Question</u></b>** 
<br>To ask the Minister for Law for each year between 2018 and 2022  (a) what is the number of cases in which personal costs orders are sought by the Public  Prosecutor against a defence counsel; (b) how many of such orders are granted by the  courts; and (c) what are the maximum and median quantum of personal costs orders (i) sought by the Public Prosecutor and (ii) granted by the courts respectively.

**<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>** 

{:start="1"} 
1.  The Courts decide on whether costs should be paid by Counsel.  This is so in both civil and criminal cases. This is a power that the Courts have always  had. Costs will generally be ordered against a defence counsel, in criminal cases, where  (a) the defence counsel acted improperly, unreasonably or negligently, (b) the conduct led  to the incurring of unnecessary costs, and (c) it is just, in all the circumstances, to make the order.

2.  There were at least 16 cases between 2018 and 2022 in which the Courts ordered  defence counsel to personally pay costs, including civil cases initiated by accused persons which were related to their criminal cases. The maximum and median quantum of the  personal costs orders imposed in these cases were $20,000 and $3,750, respectively.

3.  Cases where personal costs orders were sought by the Public Prosecutor against a defence counsel are not specifically tracked. These are steps which take place within the  context of Court proceedings.
