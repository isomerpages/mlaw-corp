1.             The Answer relates to Community Centres and Clubs which are on land managed by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The vast majority of Community Centres and Clubs are on land managed by the SLA.

2.           SLA values the rent for tenancies that it issues for Community Centres and Clubs at the prevailing market rate for Civic & Community Institution use, taking into consideration various parameters such as location, floor area, land area, and also the specific types of other uses (e.g. childcare centre, shops) within the development.
