<b>Ms Hazel Poa (Non-Constituency Member of Parliament)</b>

<b><u>Question</u></b>
<br>To ask the Minister for Law since 2018 and for black-and-white bungalows, what is the number of instances of the Singapore Land Authority (i) renting out them at exactly the amount of guide rent (ii) spending over $500,000 in essential repair works to restore them (iii) allowing the tenants to build swimming pools within the rented properties and (iv) clearing adjacent state land on the tenant’s request which is not part of the rented property.

<b><u>Written Answer:</u></b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp; The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) does not specifically track the number of cases involving residential heritage bungalows managed by SLA, which fall into the categories set out by the Member.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp; SLA’s approach with regard to the management of State properties was explained in detail in Parliament on 3 July 2023. The Member can refer to the speeches as well as to the various clarifications addressed in Parliament. We highlight the following two points:

a.	On the rental of properties at exactly the guide rent – as explained in Parliament on 3 July 2023, SLA’s practice for its residential State properties is that these properties can be rented out if the offered rent is equal to or above the guide rent. Thus, there would have been cases where residential heritage bungalows were rented out exactly at the guide rent. 

b.	On site clearance – SLA’s approach to cases where there is feedback on issues related to vegetated land located within and adjacent to the properties, including whether site clearance is required, is to assess each case on its merits, depending on the specific circumstances, and always with a view to safeguarding SLA’s interests as the landlord. SLA will take into consideration, amongst other factors, whether there are any public health and safety concerns, the specific tenancy details and how SLA’s interests would be best achieved in the context of the tenancy and its surrounding circumstances. The solution to the issues may also be site-specific.
