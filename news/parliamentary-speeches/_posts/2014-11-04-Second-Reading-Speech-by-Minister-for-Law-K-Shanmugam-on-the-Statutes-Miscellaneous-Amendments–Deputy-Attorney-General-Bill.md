Mr Speaker,

<li>Introduction</li>
</ol>

2. Sir, during the debate on the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, I explained the rationale for creating the new office of the Deputy Attorney-General (DAG).


{:start="3"}
3. This Bill introduces a number of consequential amendments to other Acts to ensure that the DAG has the necessary powers or privileges to carry out his responsibilities.

5. The DAG assigned by the Attorney-General to have control and direction over criminal prosecutions and proceedings under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) or other written law will have all the powers of the Public Prosecutor.


{:start="6"}
6. The DAG will be allowed to appear on behalf of the Government before the courts, to lead evidence before an inquiry, and to appear before and address the inquiry body on any matter at the direction of the Attorney-General, similar to other legal officers.


{:start="7"}
7. A DAG who is not already a Senior Counsel (SC) will be deemed appointed as SC on the date of his or her appointment as DAG. The DAG will rank after the Attorney-General and before the Solicitor-General in precedence.


{:start="8"}
8. The DAG will also be a Law Revision Commissioner, an ex-officio member of the Senate of the Singapore Academy of Law, and if he or she holds office as DAG for at least 2 years, then a Fellow of the Singapore Academy of Law.
