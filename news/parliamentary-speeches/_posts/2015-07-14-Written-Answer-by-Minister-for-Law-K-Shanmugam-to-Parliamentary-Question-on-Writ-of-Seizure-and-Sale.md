**Mr Pritam Singh, Member of Parliament for Aljunied GRC**

**<u>Question:</u>**  
To ask the Minister for Law whether the Ministry will consider subsidising or waiving the cost of executing a Writ of Seizure and Sale at the State Courts for low-income Singaporeans and those earning below $1,500 who seek to recover unpaid salaries from errant employers. 


**<u>Answer:</u>**  


1. A Writ of Seizure and Sale is needed before a party can seize and sell his debtor’s movable property, to satisfy the judgment debt against him and the costs of executing the writ. The costs of executing a Writ of Seizure and Sale are to be paid by the judgment debtor unless the Court orders otherwise. There are existing avenues for obtaining a waiver or deferment of the costs associated with executing a Writ of Seizure and Sale at the State Courts.


2. Any party can apply to the registrar of the State Courts to waive or defer the payment of fees or deposits that are payable to the court. The court does not charge any fees for applying for such a waiver. The registrar of the State Courts will consider all the facts of the specific situation when exercising the discretion to waive or defer the payment of such fees, including the litigant’s financial abilities or circumstances.  


3. In addition, the Legal Aid Bureau may provide legal aid in relation to the execution of a Writ and Seizure and Sale, including that arising from an employment or labour dispute. Legal aid would be granted if the applicant satisfies the requisite tests based on means and merits. A person who receives legal aid is not liable for fees or deposits that are payable to the court.
