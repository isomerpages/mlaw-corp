Note by Senior Minister of State for Law, Indranee Rajah S.C., on Transforming the Family Justice System

15 Jul 2014 Posted in [Legal Industry Newsletters](/news/legal-industry-newsletters/)

SMS has written a note highlighting the key recommendations by the Committee for Family Justice, including the role of Judges and lawyers in the new landscape.

<i>“As all family lawyers know, family cases are far less about legal issues than they are about emotional ones. Clients who are otherwise rational and logical can, in family disputes, take intransigent positions on matters which, viewed objectively, should never be brought to court but end up being litigated due to the inability to separate the legal issues from the emotional ones.”</i>
