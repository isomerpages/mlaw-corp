Note by Senior Minister of State for Law, Indranee Rajah S.C., on the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016

20 Sep 2016 Posted in [Legal Industry Newsletters](/news/legal-industry-newsletters/)

The Administration of Justice (Protection) Act was enacted in Parliament on 15 August 2016. The Act writes the existing law on contempt of court into statute, bringing greater clarity and certainty to the law. The attached note by Senior Minister of State for Law, Ms Indranee Rajah S.C., serves as a “Five minute Guide” to the Act, to help de-mystify its key provisions. It also addresses issues which may be of particular interest to practitioners – for example, whether practitioners can make statements to the media regarding on-going cases they are involved in.
