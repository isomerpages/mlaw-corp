Note by Senior Minister of State for Law, Indranee Rajah S.C., on the Choice of Court Agreements Act 2016

26 Apr 2016 Posted in [Legal Industry Newsletters](/news/legal-industry-newsletters/)

The Choice of Court Agreements Act ("CCAA") was enacted in Parliament on Thursday, 14 April.

This is a significant step forward in extending the enforceability of Singapore court judgments in civil and commercial matters, as well as in having exclusive choice of court agreements upheld.

Attached is a Note by Senior Minister of State for Law, Ms Indranee Rajah S.C., on the CCAA and the Hague Convention which it implements.
