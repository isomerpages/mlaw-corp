10 Oct 2017 Posted in [Legal Industry Newsletters](/news/legal-industry-newsletters/)

Design drives innovation. Singapore has made amendments to its design regime to facilitate design, which in turn will help foster innovation.

Addressing this topic, Senior Minister of State for Law and Finance, Ms Indranee Rajah, delivered the Keynote Address at the Design Law Reform Conference on 19 Sep 2017. 

The conference was convened by the NUS E.W. Barker Centre for Law and Business, and the Oxford Intellectual Property Research Centre.

This Note outlines the key messages from the address, including amendments introduced in the Registered Designs (Amendment) Act 2017 passed by Parliament in May, and how practitioners can support Singapore businesses in the management and use of intellectual property to grow and internationalise.
