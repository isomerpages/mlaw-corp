Note by Senior Minister of State for Law, Indranee Rajah S.C., on Combating Transnational Crime
---

29 Jul 2014 Posted in [Legal Industry Newsletters](/news/legal-industry-newsletters/){:target="_blank"}

The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA) was enacted 14 years ago against the backdrop of trade liberalisation and rapid globalisation. Increased international trade and cross-border transactions have also seen more cross-border crime. The need for effective international cooperation to combat transnational crimes and criminal organisations that try to exploit the loopholes caused by national boundaries and differences between enforcement jurisdictions of different countries is even more relevant in today's interconnected world.


In the attached note below, Senior Minister of State for Law, Ms Indranee Rajah S.C., outlines the recent legislative amendments aimed at enhancing the mutual legal assistance and international cooperation framework between Singapore and foreign states in the fight against transnational crime.
