The Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill and the Intellectual Property (Amendment) Bill, passed in Parliament on 12 January 2022, will go some way in ensuring that Singapore continues to grow as a trusted, conducive and efficient dispute resolution and intellectual property hub. 

These are part of efforts to ensure that Singapore remains attractive to businesses, while at the same time maintain a level playing field for our local legal fraternity.
