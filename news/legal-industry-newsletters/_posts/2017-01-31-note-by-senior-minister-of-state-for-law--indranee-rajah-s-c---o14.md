31 Jan 2017 Posted in [Legal Industry Newsletters](/news/legal-industry-newsletters/)

The Mediation Bill, which was passed in Parliament on 10 January 2017, is part of our on-going efforts to strengthen Singapore’s position as a premier international commercial dispute resolution hub. The establishment of a framework for commercial mediation will bolster Singapore’s overall attractiveness as a business hub, and create value for other parts of the economy.

This Note summarizes the policy objectives and provisions of the Mediation Bill and related amendments to the Legal Profession Act.
