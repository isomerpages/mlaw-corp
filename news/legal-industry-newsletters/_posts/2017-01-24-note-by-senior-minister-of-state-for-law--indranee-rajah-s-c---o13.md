Note by Senior Minister of State for Law, Indranee Rajah S.C., on Civil Law (Amendment) Bill

24 Jan 2017 Posted in [Legal Industry Newsletters](/news/legal-industry-newsletters/)

In the January 2017 sitting of Parliament, MinLaw took two important steps to reinforce Singapore as a leading dispute resolution hub. One of these was to amend the Civil Law Act to establish a framework for third party funding. Initially this will be permitted for international commercial arbitration. 

This Note by SMS Indranee Rajah summarises the provisions and policy objectives of the amendments to the Civil Law Act.
