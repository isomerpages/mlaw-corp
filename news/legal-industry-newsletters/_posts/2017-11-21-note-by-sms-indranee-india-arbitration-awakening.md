India is welcoming arbitration. This will present opportunities for arbitration professionals in both India and Singapore.

India’s arbitration awakening was one of the topics addressed by Senior Minister of State for Law and Finance, Ms Indranee Rajah SC, in her speeches at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) India Conference in New Delhi on 12 October 2017.

This Note outlines the key messages of the speeches, including how Singapore and Indian arbitration professionals can work together for mutual benefit, and how Singapore has kept up with the evolving dispute resolution landscape, by developing a full suite of international dispute resolution services for parties to select from depending on their needs and preferences.
