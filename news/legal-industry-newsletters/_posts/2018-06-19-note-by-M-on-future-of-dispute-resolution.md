Note by Second Minister for Law, Finance and Education, Indranee Rajah, on Future of Dispute Resolution
---

19 Jun 2018 Posted in [Legal Industry Newsletters](/news/legal-industry-newsletters/)

Singapore and the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) moved up the ranks again in the 2018 International Arbitration Survey. Singapore is now the 3rd most preferred seat of arbitration globally, while SIAC is the 3rd most preferred arbitral institution in the world. This makes Singapore and SIAC the top seat and institution in Asia respectively.

These achievements bear testament to Singapore’s success as an international dispute resolution hub.

With the growth of Asia, there are many more opportunities for Singapore and the dispute resolution community. These opportunities were among the issues addressed by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Second Minister for Finance, Education and Law, Ms Indranee Rajah SC, in her Opening Address at the SIAC Congress 2018 Gala Dinner.

This Note outlines the key messages of the Opening Address, including how Singapore and the dispute resolution community can position themselves to seize new opportunities in the future, and work together to take dispute resolution in Singapore to even greater heights.
