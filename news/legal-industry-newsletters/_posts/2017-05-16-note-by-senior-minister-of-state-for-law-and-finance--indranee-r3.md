The “Tech Start for Law” programme was launched on 1 March 2017 to help Singapore law practices embrace and leverage technology. Under the programme, Singapore law practices can apply for funding support of up to 70% of the first-year cost of adopting technology products for practice management, online research and online marketing.

This Note explains why it is important for law firms to adopt technology and how they can start doing so with support from the Government.
