Honourable Justice Tejas Karia, Judge of the High Court of Delhi
Mr Davinder Singh SC, Chairman of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)
Ms Lucy Reed, President of SIAC Court of Arbitration
Mr V.P Singh, Member of SIAC Court
Ms Gloria Lim, CEO of SIAC

To our many distinguished guests
Ladies and gentlemen

<b>Introduction</b>

{:start="1"}
1. A very good afternoon to all of you.

{:start="2"}
2. First, let me say what a real pleasure it is to be back here in Delhi. I have come here for many reasons, but I think those of you who know me well, know that one reason I come here is for the food. I love India, and it is one reason I keep coming back.

{:start="3"}
3. The other reason, not a secondary reason, is of course, to be here to support the work of SIAC - the work that Davinder, Lucy and Gloria have done. Lots of sacrifices, lots of hard work reaching out to all of you and really being in a very, very important market for SIAC, which is India.

{:start="4"}
4. Another reason is of course, to see my old friend, His Excellency Arjun Ram Meghwal. Minister, it is very good to see you again!

<b>1st Joint Consultative Meeting</b>

{:start="5"}
5. Those of you who do not know, or have not chatted with His Excellency personally, let me just say a few words about him.

{:start="6"}
6. I first met Minister online. We were across a Zoom camera, it was not during COVID, but we had a Zoom meeting. There he was, in his office, and there I am, in my office. This was the occasion of our two ministries signing an MOU in March last year. The purpose of the MOU is to strengthen collaboration between our two ministries and our two countries, and to strengthen our legal and dispute resolution cooperation framework. Even through the screen, as I saw Minister then, his warmth and his sincerity came through.

{:start="7"}
7. Three months ago, I had the privilege of meeting Minister in person this time, during his visit to Singapore. We convened, on the occasion of his visit, the inaugural Joint Consultative Committee meeting. This was a meeting that was constituted under the MOU that we had signed. We have a great meeting, underscored by, of course, food. We had a great lunch. I hosted him to a Japanese-Indian fusion lunch, and we had a very good meal. But more than just having a meeting. I think this symbolises how important the Singapore-India relationship is.

{:start="8"}
8. I know this is an arbitration conference, but rather than just speak about arbitration, I thought I would focus on the macro perspective of the Singapore-India relationship - why it is important and why that relationship, particularly taking place in the context of a rising
Asia, is all the more important for us to cultivate, to nurture and to find fresh and new ways of collaboration. I believe that we will conclude with an understanding that there are indeed opportunities for us to enhance the rules-based order that we see, begin to falter. I think we can strengthen it in Asia.

{:start="9"}
9. Over the last couple of years, we have seen the law ministries of India and Singapore come closer, understanding that there is value in collaborating, cooperating, and knowing that if we come together, one plus one can be much more than two.

{:start="10"}
10. During our meeting with Minister Meghwal, we exchanged views on our experiences in international commercial dispute resolution — a topic that is, of course, particularly pertinent today.

{:start="11"}
11. Two features of our conversations stood out for me.

{:start="12"}
12. <u>First</u>, we are very aligned in not just the legal heritage that we share, but we are very aligned in the values that we share.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) We share a strong belief in the principles that form the foundation of a robust and effective dispute resolution framework. One that is premised on rule of law, built on trust, independence, transparency, efficiency, and accountability.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) We also agree that such a system will be crucial to supporting businesses, providing the stability, predictability, and fairness that businesses need to thrive, especially in today’s complex, interconnected, but increasingly fractured global marketplace.</p>

{:start="13"}
13. <u>Second</u>, what struck me in our conversations was how committed India was to progressing its reforms.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) The steps that India is taking to modernise its arbitration and dispute resolution systems are both impressive, as well as impactful.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) His Excellency and his delegation shared with me that, over the years, India has introduced several transformative measures in its Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act. This includes:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(a) Promoting institutional arbitration, to ensure greater reliability and professionalism in the entire process.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(b) Setting stricter timelines for completing arbitration proceedings, in the knowledge that we don't want to be involved in cases that have a long tail that turns out unnecessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(c) Recognising emergency arbitration, allowing parties to seek interim relief, providing quicker solutions.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(d) Finally, restricting the grounds for challenging arbitral awards, to avoid unnecessary delays and interventions. And really having the ethos to uphold the choice that parties have made, which is the choice to engage in arbitration and thereafter to be bound by the arbitral award.</p>

{:start="14"}
14. These reforms are not only a testament to India's commitment to improving its arbitration framework, but also reflect the shared vision of both our nations, and indeed, both our
legal systems - to create a more transparent, efficient, and globally recognised system for dispute resolution.

{:start="15"}
15. All of that is taking place in the context of the rise of Asia as an economic powerhouse, and I think that is clear. Asia today is a key driver of trade, investment, and indeed also of technological advancement.

{:start="16"}
16. Today, Asia accounts for more than 40% of the global GDP, about 39% of global exports, and 37% of global imports. It also attracts around 40% of the world's foreign direct investments (FDI), and accounts for 70% of all such inflows into developing countries. India and ASEAN in which Singapore sits - these two regions also stand at a transformative juncture in our history and in our development, and is also quickly emerging as a dynamic global economic powerhouse.

<b>Growth of India</b>

{:start="17"}
17. India, as we heard Honourable Minister say earlier, is on track to become the world’s third-largest economy. ASEAN as a bloc, is also on track to become the world's fourth largest economy, both by 2030 or thereabouts. Both are driven by robust growth, a young population, an expanding middle class, and rapid urbanisation.

{:start="18"}
18. India is the fastest-growing major economy, consistently expanding at a rate of 7% or more, even in the face of global economic challenges, supply chain disruptions, and even through COVID.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) Over 50% of India’s population is under the age of 25, positioning the country to become a driving force in the global workforce for decades to come. In fact, India is projected to have the largest workforce in the world by 2030, with a labour force of more than 1 billion people.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) By 2030, India is expected to have over 600 million people in its middle class – more than double its current size, driving demand for goods and services across sectors, from technology and healthcare to infrastructure and financial products. The talent and the scale that India has is a formidable combination.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(3) At the same time, India is also rapidly emerging as a leader in manufacturing and digital innovation. The country has world-class capabilities in FinTech, renewable energy, and space technologies.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(a) India’s digital ecosystem is already one of the largest and fastest growing in the world, with over 1 billion internet users, accounting for over 70% of its population.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(b) Earlier, Minister spoke about its leadership in FinTech, including the rise of platforms, like UPI (Unified Payments Interface), today setting global standards in fast payments.</p>

{:start="19"}
19. The immense scale, depth of talent, combined with growing sophistication across multiple sectors, I believe has given India significant strategic weight on the global stage.

{:start="20"}
20. However, with rapid economic expansion and growth comes also greater global responsibility and exposure. As India expands its influence, it will face new challenges that must be navigated with care. Many Indian businesses and practitioners are acutely aware of this reality.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) In fact, during a roundtable discussion with Indian legal and business practitioners, back in August 2025 on the sidelines of the Singapore Convention Week, one theme that emerged was the concerns about the shifting geopolitical environment, and how it affects the growth of Indian businesses and the broader economy.</p>

{:start="21"}
21. India, like many rising powers, is also faced with a complex triad of strategic dependencies, which Prime Minister Modi has acknowledged with some candour, at an event in Gujarat's Bhavnagar.

{:start="22"}
22. These dependencies straddle three major powers. Let me quickly speak about that.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) <b>First, the dependence on the US.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(a) The US is India’s largest export destination, and a crucial source of revenue for Indian businesses today. We will have to think about what happens in the foreseeable future, but today, it is the largest source.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(b) Over 70% of all H-1B visas issued in FY2023 went to Indian professionals, and American universities educate hundreds of thousands of Indian students.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(c) US defense and technology systems, such as engines, sensors, missiles, and drones, form an essential part of India’s military modernisation.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) <b>Second, the dependence on China.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(a) India imports vast quantities of electronics, machinery, solar components, rare earth minerals and smartphone parts from China. Even industries where India excels, like pharmaceuticals, will have significant Chinese components or inputs.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(b) This dependency will impact supply chains, trade balances, and also other strategic considerations, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions in the region.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(3) <b>Third, the dependence on Russia.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left: 70px">
(a) 60–70% of its defence platforms, from aircraft to submarines, are rooted in Russian technology. Russian crude oil, which at one point made up 40% of India's total imports, continues to play a key role in India’s energy needs.</p>

{:start="23"}
23. I believe these strategic dependencies will require India to balance the interests of these three major powers, where geopolitical priorities between the three, amongst the three and within the three of them with other countries, will not always be aligned. In fact, it will shift from time to time. Navigating this delicate balance will be no small feat, and it will demand careful diplomacy and strategic foresight.

{:start="24"}
24. At the same time, I believe that India is not approaching these challenges passively – there is a serious plan.

{:start="25"}
25. It is actively positioning itself to strengthen its own domestic capabilities and diversify its supply chains.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) Initiatives, like “Make in India”, or “Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India)” underscore India’s ambition to reduce dependence on external sources.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) India’s “Viksit Bharat 2047” vision also outlines its long-term strategy for national development – to develop India into a completely developed nation, by its 100th anniversary of independence in 2047, and to become a US$30 trillion economy by 2047.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(3) Just 4 days ago, at the 98th AGM and Annual Convention of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal emphasised four key dimensions for India to become a developed nation by 2047: boosting domestic manufacturing, developing a skilled workforce, creating an investment-friendly ecosystem, and embracing cutting-edge technology.</p>

{:start="26"}
26. Why am I giving this background? This is not an economic lesson or a lecture, but I gave this background so that when I talk about the next steps that I believe we can enter into between Singapore and India, there is a context. That context is also in a renewed belief in anchoring thought leadership, as well as a rules-based order in Asia.

{:start="27"}
27. I believe that India’s path forward lies not only in strengthening its own domestic capabilities, which I have outlined, but also, in developing networks and partnerships, such as partnerships with countries like Singapore. This is where our collaboration, based on shared values, mutual interests, becomes even more significant.

<b>Why Singapore</b>

{:start="28"}
28. Let me now share some reasons why I believe this partnership can endure for the long term.

{:start="29"}
29. <u>First</u>, India and Singapore’s partnership is rooted in a unique form of interdependence, – not dependence but interdependence, where our success is intrinsically linked, rather than one being dependent on the other.

{:start="30"}
30. Singapore today is one of India's top partners in trade and investment. Singapore has been India's largest source of FDI for seven consecutive years, and is one of India's largest trading partners.

{:start="31"}
31. A key cornerstone of this partnership has been the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA). This has fostered seamless trade, investment, and deep talent exchange between our countries. Through CECA, we have created a strong foundation for deeper economic integration, opening up even greater and new opportunities for businesses, entrepreneurs, and professionals in both Singapore and India.

{:start="32"}
32. The India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable, now held annually, has become a key platform for high-level discussions on strengthening bilateral relations. This roundtable brings together ministers, business leaders from both countries, ensuring that the partnership remains relevant, aligned, and neutral in the context of the geopolitical situation that we see around us. The third roundtable was held three months ago, and we discussed deeper cooperation in a wide range of matters.

{:start="33"}
33. The recently launched Singapore-India Economic Cooperation Roadmap marks another significant milestone in our relationship, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this year. This roadmap is a very forward-looking collaboration roadmap across different sectors, such as technology, innovation, green manufacturing and supply chain resilience.

{:start="34"}
34. A clear reflection of Singapore's confidence, on the other hand, in India's market is the establishment of the Singapore Business Federation (SBF)’s 4th Enterprise Centre (SEC) in Bengaluru - the first such centre outside ASEAN, just about 2 weeks ago. This new centre is set to engage over 470 companies over the next two years, through initiatives, like business missions, roundtables, and seminars, providing a vital platform for collaboration and knowledge exchange.

{:start="35"}
35. I see all of these as opportunities for legal and dispute resolution services on both sides to come even closer together. That is because law is really never far from business. You can see this reflect itself in international arbitration.

{:start="36"}
36. As Asia rises and grows, if you see the numbers I cited earlier, the caseloads at Asian arbitral institutions have also grown in tandem. Asian seats and arbitral institutions are also growing in acceptance and popularity.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) According to the Queen Mary University of London and White &amp; Case’s International Arbitration Survey, Asian seats and arbitral institutions account for at least half in the top 10 today.</p>

{:start="37"}
37. I therefore see Asia as having the credibility, the capacity, and the strategic vision, to help restore confidence in the fractured world order that we see today, and to lead the developments in the field of international dispute settlement.

{:start="38"}
38. I would argue that far from fading, rules-based cooperation is in fact gaining strength outside of the West. For example, today, Asia holds the largest trade pact in history - the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The RCEP covers nearly a third of the world's population. Asia, I believe, is emerging as a standard bearer for the legitimacy and resilience of the international world order.

{:start="39"}
39. <u>Second</u>, between Singapore and India, we share deep cultural, as well as historical ties.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) Beyond economics, India and Singapore share deep cultural, historical, and even legal connections that have grown stronger over the years.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) On legal talent, both our Bars have deep legal talent. Innovation, expansion, are all buzzwords in both our legal Bars.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(3) The large Indian diaspora in Singapore acts as a crucial bridge between our two nations, strengthening and deepening people-to-people ties, and facilitating smoother business and diplomatic engagements. These shared roots foster a sense of trust and familiarity,</p>

{:start="40"}
40. <u>Third</u>, Singapore’s diplomatic neutrality and commitment to the rule of law.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) Our approach has always been built on neutrality, openness, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law. These principles make Singapore a reliable and trusted partner for India, particularly in today’s geopolitical landscape.</p>

{:start="41"}
41. As India continues to expand its economic and geopolitical footprint, Singapore is uniquely positioned to complement India’s rising economic clout. Singapore’s role as a trusted partner can help India navigate its complex global responsibilities and advance its interests on the world stage.

{:start="42"}
42. Singapore offers India a unique value proposition when it comes to dispute resolution - the topic we are speaking about today.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) As a neutral, rules-based, trusted platform, Singapore provides the stability and the transparency needed for resolving complex commercial and international disputes.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) We fully recognise that Indian parties will naturally prefer to choose Indian arbitral institutions when given the option –this is your home country, they are familiar and comfortable. We understand and we respect this. But there will be situations, as it is in Singapore as well, where the home jurisdiction as a venue and as a seat cannot be insisted upon. It is these occasions that we believe Singapore can come in handy.</p>

{:start="43"}
43. Our goal is to offer a trusted second option – one that makes the process as comfortable and as familiar as possible.

{:start="44"}
44. Indian counsel can today represent Indian clients in arbitration proceedings in Singapore without restrictions. Arbitrators and counsel coming to Singapore for arbitration-related matters are exempt from applying for a work pass, and they are one of the few groups in Singapore granted this privilege.

{:start="45"}
45. Indian businesses can also have a choice of different dispute resolution mechanisms, institutions, seats, venue, arbitrators, mediators – and as I said earlier, counsel as well.

{:start="46"}
46. Other than SIAC, we also have many other international arbitral institutions, all located at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore. These include Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), World Intellectual Property Organization Arbitration and Mediation Centre (WIPO AMC), International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Court of Arbitration, American Arbitration Association International Centre for Dispute Resolution (AAA-ICDR), and soon, Chinese arbitral institutions like the Shanghai International Arbitration Center (SHIAC) will also set up in Maxwell Chambers.

{:start="47"}
47. Why are we doing this? Well, we host all these institutions in Singapore because we see value in the work that they do, and we want to work further and deeper with each of them to bring that value into Asia.

{:start="48"}
48. Importantly, Singapore can also be an accepted and trusted venue by India's counterparts in international dispute resolution. I think that is also borne out by the Queen Mary Survey. Singapore is one of only two jurisdictions globally to be ranked among the top five preferred seats for arbitration across all regions.

{:start="49"}
49. A prime example of this trust, which we are very privileged to enjoy, is the collaboration between the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC) and the Bahrain International Commercial Court (BICC), which was officially launched a short couple of weeks ago.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) Under this collaboration, appeals from the BICC will be heard by the International Committee of the SICC, providing an added layer of confidence for users.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) This mechanism is designed to enhance the predictability, as well as the reliability of the legal environment in Bahrain, ensuring that cross-border businesses have access to a trusted and impartial forum for dispute resolution.</p>

<b>Looking Ahead</b>

{:start="50"}
50. I move on to my final point to talk about international arbitration in this landscape. I believe that international arbitration will, if not already, operate in a very challenging environment. Recent developments in global trade, investment and commerce - I think you have seen all that – have led to excess tariffs, the paralysis of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Appellate Body, and the retreat of a number of States from foundational treaties such as something basic, like the Energy Charter Treaty.

{:start="51"}
51. These developments point to a broader loss of trust in the rules-based trading system that have hitherto contributed to decades of global economic growth. I think nowhere has this been more important than in Asia, where predictable rules and a stable dispute resolution mechanism have enabled extraordinary economic expansion. It has to be said that the loss of trust is not confined just to trade. It is spilling over into the broader field of dispute resolution, including arbitration. If trust in arbitration continues to erode, we may soon face, not only reputational challenges, but also a reversal of the pro-arbitration stance taken by the courts.

{:start="52"}
52. Therefore, it is vital for us to re-evaluate our frameworks in the context of the global order today, and the retreat from a rules-based system that we see - at least more pronouncedly in the Western economies - to see how we can evolve our framework to better serve the needs of businesses worldwide.

{:start="53"}
53. On this, I see Asia's role as being increasingly important, not only in upholding the international world legal order, but in taking steps to improve it. Today, we have a unique opportunity to provide and anchor thought leadership on international dispute resolution in Asia, and that is concurrent with the rise and expansion of the Asian economies that I spoke about earlier. Not simply to operate within a system that has been designed elsewhere and which we port over into Asia, but to better shape our own vision of an international rule of law, which can be contextualised to, and therefore operate better, in Asia.

{:start="54"}
54. How do we do this? I think we need to think about re-establishing a clear, rules-based trading system, where we go back to having predictable rules, a stable dispute resolution mechanism, options for parties to choose different modalities of dispute resolution .

{:start="55"}
55. What are some suggestions that I could consider? Well, let me offer two brief suggestions.

<b>A. Sector-specific arbitration rules</b>

{:start="56"}
56. One, is whether arbitration rules should be tailored not only to the monetary value of a dispute, but also to the specific nature of the dispute, such as what sector the dispute comes from, whether it is complex, and whether sector expertise is needed.

{:start="57"}
57. Many leading arbitration institutions already differentiate their rules, based on the monetary value of the dispute, which is not atypical. It is usually the case, even in courts.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) Leading institutions like SIAC, ICC, London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) all offer Expedited Procedures, that ensure quicker resolutions with shorter timelines, and typically involve a sole arbitrator. These procedures have helped reduce arbitration times and costs significantly. As of 2024, I understand that more than 1,000 cases have been resolved using SIAC’s Expedited Procedures.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) SIAC has also gone one step further to introduce Streamlined Procedures – even faster than Expedited Procedures - for disputes that do not exceed SGD 1 million. The final award is expected within 90 days from the constitution of the Tribunal, making it one of the quickest arbitration processes available. Under the Streamlined Procedures, fees are capped at 50% of the maximum limits under the SIAC’s Schedule of Fees.</p>

{:start="58"}
58. Beyond looking at the monetary value to decide on the track of the arbitration proceedings, should rules also be differentiated based on the sector expertise involved in the dispute?

{:start="59"}
59. There will be strong arguments in favour of one side and the other. Sectors like technology, healthcare, and environmental law, and increasingly in the future, AI, will be new and emerging areas involving specialised knowledge that perhaps can be better addressed by arbitrators with that specific expertise.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) For example, healthcare disputes often involve highly technical or sensitive business practices. You take pharmaceutical disputes involving companies, such as Novartis, AstraZeneca, and MedTronic. They have been reported to have engaged in arbitration precisely for this reason.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) Likewise, in environmental disputes, which often have public interest implications, greater transparency in arbitration could help in fairness, as well as accountability of the process.</p>

{:start="60"}
60. SIAC's development of a Restructuring and Insolvency Protocol is a good example of that sector-specific differentiation. It addresses complex issues, like cross-border claims, multi-party involvement, and the need for financial expertise, tailor made for the specific purposes of that particular sector. We deal with cross border restructuring in perhaps a different way that you might do for a commercial case or with an IP case. Having specific sector differentiated rules for that might well be useful.

{:start="61"}
61. As industries evolve and new challenges arise, we must continue to explore whether sector-specific rules could give us that flexibility and that specific application, particularly for complex, new and emerging areas.

<b>B. Enforcement of arbitral awards</b>

{:start="62"}
62. The second suggestion that I want to make is in the area of the enforcement of the awards. It is really an old chestnut. Those of us who studied arbitration in school, this is perhaps one of the topics that came up then. It is still an issue today, and it remains a critical area.

{:start="63"}
63. While arbitration offers a swift, impartial forum for dispute resolution, the enforceability of awards continues to present significant challenges.

{:start="64"}
64. Despite the framework established years ago by the New York Convention, and its adoption by 172 Parties, a universal standard for enforcing arbitral awards across all jurisdictions remains elusive.

{:start="65"}
65. If arbitral awards can be easily challenged, this leads to delay, prolonged uncertainty for the parties that seek to rely on arbitration, to resolve their cross-border disputes. For example, the UK’s 2023-2024 Commercial Court Report showed an increase in the number of challenges to arbitral awards, on grounds of procedural irregularity, jurisdiction, and points of law, compared to the year before.

{:start="66"}
66. It should be noted that very few of these challenges were successful. If you took a straw poll of the increased number of challenges, there were far fewer cases which turned out
to be successful. This, of course, is encouraging evidence of the supportive posture taken by courts towards arbitration, and of the veracity of the arbitral awards. But the commencement and the hearing of these challenges nonetheless then prolongs uncertainty, which businesses in a fast-moving operating environment can ill afford.

{:start="67"}
67. A notable example which colleagues here would be familiar with, is P&amp;ID v Nigeria, which has been well documented and well written about.

{:start="68"}
68. It concerns a contract signed by Nigeria for a 20-year gas supply with Process and Industrial Development (P&amp;ID), and the contract required a supply of wet gas to P&amp;ID. In return, the gas would be returned to Nigeria for power generation. What happened was a prolonged arbitration resulted in a substantial award against Nigeria in 2017 - US$6.6 million, plus interest. A few years later, it became closer to US$11 million because of the interest. Not having defended the arbitration proceeding substantively, Nigeria then sought to challenge the enforcement of the award quite belatedly - close to 10 years after the commencement of the arbitration.

{:start="69"}
69. In challenging the enforcement of the awards, a new factor came up. It found evidence that the contract was procured by bribes. There was corruption involved by officials and misuse of privileged documents. Eventually, after a hearing, the English High Court set aside the award in Nigeria's favour. Without taking away anything on public policy grounds, but the question becomes - how do we ensure that, if we seek to raise substantive grounds, that the party raises it in the arbitration, and not keep it for deployment at the enforcement stage several years later?

{:start="70"}
70. This case has, if you look at articles, at least those that I have seen, intensified doubts over the enforcement process, and whether or not, between the enforcement process and the arbitral process itself, there ought to be greater synergy. There have been commentary on the failure of international arbitration to properly protect the public interest.

{:start="71"}
71. Whilst this case relates to investment arbitration, the risk is that that loss of faith in the system, and in the way in which awards are considered for enforcement, becomes generalised, affecting even commercial arbitration. We have to be careful not to let trust in the arbitration system as a whole erode.

{:start="72"}
72. One immediate step that we could do is to have prosecutors, judges, arbitral institutions, academics, practitioners, come together to foster greater dialogue on the procedural challenges, such as delays in enforcement, setting-aside proceedings, or requests for court assistance in arbitration.

{:start="73"}
73. This initiative can well help promote greater alignment across jurisdictions. Last year, Singapore launched the Forum of Chief Legal Advisors, which, as its name suggests, brings together Chief Legal Advisors of several countries, including Justice Ministers, Attorneys-General, and Prosecutors-General, to address current legal issues. This could serve as a topic for discussion at the second meeting next year.

{:start="74"}
74. Other ideas, to grapple with enforcement, maybe untested currently, could be:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) To have a public register tracking the compliance of arbitral awards. This register would include records of paid, partially-paid, or completely non-compliant parties, encouraging better adherence to arbitration rulings. The European Union (EU), I understand, piloted a similar system with positive results, reducing non-compliance rates by about 15%.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) Alternatively, we could consider an Automatic Stay Bond System. If you choose to challenge the enforceability of an award or seek to set aside an award, you would be required to post a bond for the duration of the stay of enforcement. This would ensure merits-based appeals, and therefore reduce delays in arbitration. If you go back to the point I made earlier about statistics in the English High Court, where less than half of the proceedings to challenge awards were ultimately successful.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(3) Or what about having a digital platform where arbitral awards and enforcement requests are uploaded and can be processed across participating courts? This would reduce documentary friction and also increase transparency, so that one cannot have arbitrage between different jurisdictions in seeking to enforce awards, particularly enforcement across different jurisdictions.</p>

75. These are just some ideas, food for thought, which perhaps can be discussed at panels.

<b>Conclusion</b>

{:start="76"}
76. Let me now conclude by restating a few key points:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(1) First, if you forget everything I have said earlier, please remember that I believe that, for the reasons I cited earlier, there is immense potential for arbitration in Asia - a region that is rapidly growing and evolving in the global legal landscape, and I think will be increasingly important for the world order in decades to come.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(2) I firmly believe that by working together, Singapore and India, across all levels - government-to-government, but also across practitioners, across the Bar, across firms, by sharing insights, experiences, and best practices, I believe we can unlock even greater opportunities for all of us.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(3) Fundamentally, strengthening the arbitration ecosystem in this region requires a collective effort from all of us, as you can see from the enforcement example I gave earlier.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(4) I think dialogues like this, where we have the occasion to meet, to network like what we have today, will be extremely meaningful and very productive.</p>

77. On that note, I wish all of you a very good rest of the conference, and I look forward to meeting with you at some point in Singapore.

78. Every year, around the end of August, we host the Singapore Convention Week. It is sort of a throwback to the signing of the Singapore Convention on Mediation, but it has become more than just a week of mediation – it is on every aspect of dispute resolution, and we would warmly welcome you to Singapore to take part in Singapore Convention Week 2026.

79. Thank you very much.
