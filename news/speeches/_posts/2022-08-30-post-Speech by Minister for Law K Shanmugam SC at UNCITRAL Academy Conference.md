**Introduction**

{:start="1"}
1.	A very good morning to all of you. 

{:start="2"}
2.	Today is a milestone day for our legal industry in going digital. We are launching the Legal Technology Platform (LTP). 

**Riding the Digital Wave Collectively**

{:start="3"}
3.	If you look at the way practice is developing, clients, both domestic and international, expect legal services to be provided digitally, remotely, and around the clock. The last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic has only increased those expectations, because people can see that work can be done in that way. Face-to-face and physical meetings are important, but they need to be substantially supplemented by being able to work from anywhere, and deliver services from anywhere. Clients expect that, and that demand is going to grow. 

{:start="4"}
4.	We have been giving this much thought, even before the pandemic, because it was clear that this was the direction in which the profession and demand is going. And at the same time, we have mapped out that there was a gap between what our law firms would be able to do, in terms of readiness in moving in that direction, particularly the medium and smaller law firms, and what clients were expecting. And I think the pandemic has made that even more apparent. From our perspective, when we were mapping out the requirements, we started by talking to the lawyers and clients, which we have been doing a lot. 

**Government Giving the Extra Push**

{:start="5"}
5.	One of the key things that came from the feedback over the years is, of course, the cost of technology.

{:start="6"}
6.	We then worked with the Law Society of Singapore (LawSoc), and talked about how to work together to support the adoption of software.

{:start="7"}
 7.	Five years ago, we started with the Tech Start for Law initiative, and three years ago, we had the Tech-celerate initiative, where the Government put money in, and encouraged law firms to come onboard and upgrade. 

{:start="8"}
 8.	Those initiatives gave us a better understanding of the challenges that law firms face.  Many law firms simply do not have the economies of scale, or resources, to adapt technology – in fact, even to identify the necessary technology. Some firms prefer to have solutions that improve their legal workflows, without having to overhaul their existing systems.

{:start="9"}
9.	Multinational corporations are re-shoring production back home. According to Reshoring Initiative, which is an industry organisation, the reshoring initiatives are expected to bring back nearly 400,000 manufacturing jobs to the US this year alone. There will be a tendency to stockpile inventories of critical components. That is going to intensify competition for materials, probably leading to more price increases.

{:start="10"}
10.	So it is a very uncertain environment, no one is really able to predict how it is going to look like in the next six months, one year. Globalisation as we knew it has obviously suffered a setback. In this environment, countries have to work even harder to try and come together, to keep to what is possible in terms of cooperation, and try and keep the global trading environment as healthy as possible. Some of these trends – on reshoring, on supply chain resilience, on relying on oneself, they are not going to go away anytime soon. So, the environment is going to be different.

**Singapore Convention on Mediation**

{:start="11"}
11.	In this context, in particular now, UN and UNCITRAL have to play an even more important role, because it can easily become very fractured. I think there is a need for credible international organisations like the UN to provide a framework for international cooperation, to help in harmonising actions of nations. Where possible, countries with a similar outlook – Singapore is one of those countries – have to try and support the global trading and working environment; try and create more international structures. So we speak with the US, with China, we try and bring different countries together, to try and put together a more harmonised environment. It is not easy, but we are going to keep trying.

{:start="12"}
12.	At UNCITRAL, in particular because you promote progressive harmonisation and unification of international trade law, the thing is, you got to make sure you do, you try, that the rules are agile - to reflect these new realities and demands.

{:start="13"}
13. We in Singapore have been a staunch supporter of the UN and what UNCITRAL stands for. We recognise the importance of upholding rules-based multilateralism.

{:start="14"}
14. The Singapore Convention on Mediation is a step in this path. It was a powerful statement in support of multilateralism. When it opened for signature in Singapore in 2019, we had 46 countries signing it immediately, which I am told is the highest number of signatories on the first day for a UN convention.

{:start="15"}
15. Since then, there has been progress. The Convention has entered into force on 12 September 2020. We need more countries to come onboard and ratify.

{:start="16"}
16.	This year we are also focusing on mediation in this Conference. We have put it forward, as an alternative dispute resolution, which is relatively faster, cheaper, more flexible, and something that helps preserve business relationships, which is probably even more important in today’s landscape, which is more fractured. 

{:start="17"}
17.	The Singapore Convention on Mediation provides businesses with greater assurance that their mediated settlement agreements can be enforced cross-border. That is one of the main advantages. Much to think about, in terms of the global environment, legal environment, disruptions. A lot of think about in terms of what role mediation can play.

{:start="18"}
18.	I wish you all a very fruitful conference. Thank you.
