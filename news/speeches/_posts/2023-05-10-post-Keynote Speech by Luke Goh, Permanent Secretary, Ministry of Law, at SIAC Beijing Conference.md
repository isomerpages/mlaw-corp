{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very good morning to all of you!  It is a pleasure to be at the Beijing Conference of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, that is organised with all of your support.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitration has a long and rich history, with the crucial role of helping parties to resolve their disputes and achieve closure, so that they can move on with their projects and even their lives. 

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This goes back thousands of years to before 900BC, when we have documented stories of the wise King Solomon who famously conducted arbitrations. 


{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story is told of how King Solomon’s arbitration skills extended to resolving claims of ownership by two parties over a same baby child. He resolved it by, quite fairly, first offering to cut the baby in half, so each party could have 50:50. This would, of course, have greatly devalued what was precious about the child. One of the claimants nonetheless agreed, while the other, by offering to give up her claim and therefore saving the child’s life, proved her connection. We know how the rest of the story goes. With the baby’s parentage proven, King Solomon awarded custody to the real mother who had prioritised the child’s well-being. 


{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no doubt that arbitrators in all the centuries since, continue to provide creative solutions to disputes and conflicts.  


{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In today’s world, disputes are becoming more complex. This represents increased need, and also challenges, for arbitration.

* First, with cross-border trade, arbitrators have to develop expertise in the laws of different jurisdictions, as well as sensitivity in cross-cultural communications.

* Second, specialised rules have advanced to cater for different categories of disputes: investor-state disputes, intellectual property disputes, cases that arise in construction space, disputes in rapidly developing carbon markets and so on. 

* The advancement in technology has added another level of complexity to dispute resolution. The opportunity that technology brings to improving processes and analysis, and also new ethical considerations that may emerge.

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent months, we have seen rapid developments in AI technology related to Large Language Models. ChatGPT is one such well-known model; China’s 通义千问is another. 

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, my colleague Angeline, who is also at the conference, put this question to ChatGPT: “Will AI replace lawyers, arbitrators, mediators and judges one day?” The answer: 

* Well, on the one hand, AI and language models such as ChatGPT have the potential to change the practice of law in the areas of:

		a.	Legal research: ChatGPT and other language models can search vast amounts of legal information, including statutes, case law and legal articles, within a short time. This can help lawyers save time, increase efficiency, and allow us to focus on higher-value tasks. 

		b.	Predictive analysis: The language models can help to analyse large volumes of legal information and data, identify relevant cases, provide suggestions for legal arguments, and even predict likely outcome of cases. 

		c.	Document automation: The language models can automate the drafting of legal documents, such as contracts and legal briefs. 

* On the other hand, ChatGPT’s answer provides the view that AI cannot replace our arbitrators, mediators or judges. 

* Its reasoning is that legal disputes often involve complex issues that require the judgment in assessing the credibility of witnesses, to understand the nuances of complex legal arguments, and to provide advice and guidance in a way the parties can understand both intellectually and intuitively. 

* Disputes, as with the case King Solomon had to deal with, involved emotional, personal and ethical elements that require empathy and sensitivity, which AI tools currently lack. 


{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I have just described, is ChatGPT’s self-assessment of its strengths and current limitations. The full potential of AI and Large Language Models remains to be seen. 


{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To support our creative industries and user groups, MinLaw and IPOS have been working for some time on a new class licensing scheme for CMOs to strengthen their internal governance and their relations with both rights-holders and users of copyrighted works.

{:start="11"}
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In devising our proposed licensing scheme, we considered the experience of other countries and took reference from the World Intellectual Property Organisation Good Practice Toolkit for CMOs, and its many examples of legislation, regulation, and codes of conduct for collective management of copyright.

{:start="12"}
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most recent round of public consultations was just held in November 2022, and we will continue this work together with all stakeholders.

&nbsp;**III.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES**

{:start="13"}
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the past three decades, digital technologies have radically changed and are continuing to change how works are created, distributed, and used.

{:start="14"}
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These technologies have been immensely beneficial but have been confronted by copyright rules that never anticipated them.

    (a) For instance, search tools such as Google Books have been immensely useful, but because they require the making of digital copies, they cannot legally exist without some sort of accommodation from rights-holders and from the copyright system. And it took a decade before the US courts eventually ruled that Google Books’ uses of copyrighted works were non-infringing fair uses.

    (b) Other areas, such as digital lending, are still developing today, and the framework to licence and enable these uses is still being fought over abroad.

{:start="15"}
15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As each new way of using copyright works emerges, it presents a challenge, but also an opportunity, for rights-holders and CMOs.

    (a) Fair, practical, and reasonable licensing terms can accommodate and unlock the value of these new technologies and uses, while delivering revenue to rights-holders.

    (b) Conversely, a failure to do so can lead to these new possibilities withering on the vine, to everyone’s detriment.

{:start="16"}
16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s worth learning from the experience of the music industry, which faced its own challenges and opportunities with digital copies, piracy, and changing business models.

    (a) In 1998, the Recording Industry Association of America sought to prevent the sale of one of the first commercially successful MP3 player devices, the Rio. The lawsuit did not succeed.

    (b) At the time, global recorded music industry revenues stood at US$22.3bn, entirely due to the sale of physical copies. Since the industry relied entirely on and was built around the sale of physical copies, it was all too easy for the industry to see digital as an existential threat to its business.

    (c) Compare this to 2022, when the recorded music industry reported global revenues of US$26.2bn.

									i. US$17.6bn, or two-thirds of all revenue, comes from music streaming alone.
                 ii. An additional US$2.5bn, or just under 10%, came from performance rights.

                iii. Physical sales now only account for US$4.6bn, or under 20%.

    (d) This transformation was not easy. It took years for the initial resistance to be overcome, for the industry to figure out new business models that worked, and for things to turn around and for revenues to grow again. But the industry is now benefiting from it, and even seeing double-digit gains as it capitalises on new markets and new licensing opportunities.

    (e) And with today’s music streaming offers, the public now has access to a much wider range of music, on much better terms, than ever before. It’s quite possible that the world would have had none of this if the RIAA had succeeded in blocking the sale of the Rio and other hardware MP3 players back in 1998.

{:start="17"}
17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change is often threatening and uncomfortable, but it brings new opportunities as well – opportunities to innovate, to do things better, and sometimes even to do something completely new.

{:start="18"}
18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Print media is not recorded music, and the publishing sector faces its own unique challenges. But I hope that all stakeholders in the copyright ecosystem will be able to work together and capture these opportunities.

**IV.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONCLUSION**

{:start="19"}
19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish all of you an enjoyable and productive meeting, and we look forward to seeing the fruits of these discussions within the industry and beyond.
