<p><strong>Mr Li Mingzheng</strong>
</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Justice of the People’s Republic of China</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Zhu Zhongming</strong>
</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary-General of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr David Yu</strong>
</p>
<p>President of the Shanghai Arbitration Association</p>
<p></p>
<p>Distinguished guests</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="1"}</p>
<p>1. A very good afternoon to all of you. I am so very delighted to be able
to join you here, to participate in the Shanghai International Arbitration
Forum and the Shanghai Arbitration Week. This is my first time here and
I am very glad to be here to join you this afternoon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="2"}</p>
<p>2. When President David Yu asked me to consider attending this event when
we met earlier this year, I told him that I would be most happy to do so,
and very honoured to be here. I readily agreed, because it is important
to support our friends in Shanghai, who have been very generous in their
friendship with us in Singapore, and also very open in sharing their knowledge
and expertise.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Singapore-Shanghai Relations</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="3"}</p>
<p>3. I also have a strong affinity for Shanghai. Singapore has a number
of high-level bilateral platforms with China, and I chair one of them with
Mayor Gong Zheng – the Shanghai-Singapore Comprehensive Cooperation Council.
Partly because of this role, this is my third official visit to Shanghai
this year. I am very delighted to be back here again, to be here with all
of you, and also to be able to enjoy Shanghai.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Importance of Globalisation</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="4"}</p>
<p>4. This event is held at the sidelines of the China International Import
Expo (CIIE). The CIIE is the world’s first national-level import expo,
which demonstrates China’s firm support for trade liberalisation, as well
as economic globalisation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="5"}</p>
<p>5. Like China, Singapore also strongly supports free trade, open markets,
as well as economic integration on a global scale. In our view, it brings,
not only economic benefits, but also social benefits to our countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="6"}</p>
<p>6. We are therefore concerned, when reports show that some countries are
becoming more inward-looking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="7"}</p>
<p>7. It is therefore all the more important for like-minded countries to
work together to reverse this trend of deglobalisation, friend-shoring,
or re-shoring.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="8"}</p>
<p>8. The CIIE serves as a very good platform, to facilitate global trade,
and strengthen economic cooperation. I am very happy that Singapore has
more than 40 companies participating at the CIIE this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Importance of International Commercial Dispute Resolution in Supporting Global Trade</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="9"}</p>
<p>9. It is also very appropriate and apt that the organisers have elected
to hold the Shanghai International Arbitration Forum and the Shanghai Arbitration
Week, in conjunction with the CIIE.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="10"}</p>
<p>10. As I have always said, law follows business. Much as we sometimes
want to think that we do not like disputes or we do not want disputes to
happen, we have to accept that they are part and parcel of commercial trade,
especially international ones. It is therefore critical for parties to
give careful thought to the forum that they are comfortable with to submit
to, in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Singapore Dispute Resolution</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="11"}</p>
<p>11. As a staunch proponent of global trade and commerce, Singapore has
looked to build a dispute resolution ecosystem that businesses have confidence
in – one that is fair, neutral, and transparent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="12"}</p>
<p>12. We are honoured to have earned the trust of many around the world,
including in China and Shanghai, and who have chosen to resolve their cross-border
disputes in Singapore. And we are committed to upholding this trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="13"}</p>
<p>13. Our approach has always been to align ourselves with international
standards, so that it reduces uncertainty for businesses, and any decision
that comes out from Singapore can be enforced globally, whilst at the same
time, we recognise that different parties will have different needs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="14"}</p>
<p>14. For example, to serve Chinese parties better, the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre (SIAC) has Chinese nationals on their Board, Court,
as well as panel of arbitrators and Secretariat. All of them understand
the Chinese legal system, the Chinese way of doing business, and understand
better the needs of Chinese parties. SIAC can also do arbitrations in Chinese,
if the parties wish, and they also have an office right here in Shanghai,
so that parties can reach out to them more effectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="15"}</p>
<p>15. I think our thinking in Singapore is very similar to that in Shanghai.
We both believe in helping businesses resolve their disputes fairly, efficiently,
and effectively, so that parties can get on with their business relations.
We both believe in collaborating with other countries, to provide comprehensive
support. In fact, this is very much also aligned to today’s theme of “Openness,
Cooperation, Shared Benefits”.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Collaborations with Shanghai</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="16"}</p>
<p>16. When I met the Chairman of Shanghai International Arbitration Centre
(SHIAC) Mr Zhou Minhao in July this year, he shared with me that he was
looking to raise awareness of arbitration and mediation amongst Chinese
enterprises. He also welcomed closer collaborations between Singapore and
Shanghai. And he thought that perhaps one day, SHIAC could also set up
an office in Singapore. I told him that I completely agree with him, and
that we welcome SHIAC in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="17"}</p>
<p>17. As I said in my pre-recorded speech for the opening of Fangda’s Singapore
office just a few weeks ago, there are more benefits for all of us to collaboration.
While there will</p>
<p>undoubtedly be competition, I think this competition can be a healthy
competition. It drives all of us to do even better. Built on mutual trust,
this can help us lift the standards and improvements in both our jurisdictions.
So, whenever SHIAC is ready to expand into Singapore, we will be ready
to receive them and find them a space at Maxwell Chambers Suites!</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="18"}</p>
<p>18. It is also in this spirit, that I am here to support Shanghai Arbitration
Week, just like how Shanghai practitioners have consistently supported
the Singapore Convention Week.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start="19”}</p>
<p>19. I heard that that there are now more than 70 arbitration or disputes
weeks around the world. So many different weeks like this, with conventions,
collaborations, and conferences. The fact that today, here, we see a very
healthy attendance, shows that Shanghai is indeed one of the leading centres
for dispute resolution in the world today, as you have heard the earlier
speakers say. This is a result of many years of hard work, building up
rapport, building up trust with the business industry. It is also the collective
efforts of the Shanghai government, as well as the legal community right
here. So, my congratulations to all of you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start=“20”}</p>
<p>20. I wish all of you a very good week ahead, not just in discussing trends,
discussing latest know-how, but perhaps more importantly, also building
relationships between Singapore and Shanghai, and between the different
industries that we have, so that all of us can learn from one another and
level up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start=“21”}</p>
<p>21. Once again, thank you very much for the honour of inviting me here
to speak to you. I wish all of you a very fruitful conference ahead.</p>
<p></p>
<p>{:start=“22”}</p>
<p>22. Thank you.</p>
