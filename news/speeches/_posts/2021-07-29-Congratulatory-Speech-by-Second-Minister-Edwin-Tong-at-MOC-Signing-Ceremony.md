Your Excellency,

Minister of Justice of Japan,

Ms Kamikawa Yoko

{:start="1"}
1.	Thank you very much for the welcome to myself and to my delegation.
 
{:start="2"}
2.	Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I am very honoured to be here this afternoon, to be signing the Memorandum of Cooperation (MOC) in person, in Tokyo today.

{:start="3"}
3.	As Minister mentioned earlier, this is something that I had raised, when I met with your State Minister of Justice Mr Hiroshi Hiraguchi in March 2019, and I am glad that today we are able to see its conclusion.

**Singapore-Japan Bilateral Relations**

{:start="4"}
4.	Singapore and Japan enjoy a longstanding and a close relationship. This year marks the 55th anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations.

{:start="5"}
5.	 Our two countries have deepened and broadened our relationship and cooperation over the years, ranging from defence, environment, biomedical research to cybersecurity; and now, also supply chain connectivity, vaccine multilateralism, and of course, the resumption of business travel.

**MOC**

{:start="6"}
6.	It is therefore momentous to be able to extend and expand the scope of our already wide-ranging cooperation on this 55th anniversary.
 
{:start="7"}
7.	This MOC will institutionalise our cooperation in international commercial dispute resolution, and also in the people-to-people exchange in the legal sector.

{:start="8"}
8.	These areas are very important to both our countries. We both embrace free trade as a source of economic growth, and a multilateral rules-based trading system.

{:start="9"}
9.	Legal and dispute resolution services are means to support what we believe in.

{:start="10"}
10.	In cross-border trade and investments, what businesses need is confidence that their investments will be protected after they have decided to do business in the country.

{:start="11"}
11.	Given our two countriesâ€™ strong economic links, it is imperative for us to work more closely together to protect and enhance dispute resolution services.

{:start="12"}
12.	 I am also very happy that we are starting from a very strong base:

    a. We have regular exchanges between our governments. 
    
    b.	Our arbitration and mediation institutions have already been working closely together.
    
    c. Our lawyers and in-house counsel have also come together, to share experiences at a very high-level legal conference organised by MinLaw and Japan Association of Arbitrators in Tokyo in March 2019. Then Vice Minister of Justice Hiroyuki Tsuji delivered the opening address.

**Conclusion**

{:start="13"}
13.	 I am very confident that the Memorandum of Cooperation that we will be signing shortly will enhance our business support and also grow the economic ties between our two countries.

{:start="14"}
14.	Thank you very much, Minister, and congratulations on the signing of the MOC!

{:start="15"}
15.	Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
