Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

{:start="1"}
1.	We are really delighted to welcome you this evening to this reception. As Ambassador said earlier, we are delighted and very honoured by your presence. 

{:start="2"}
2.	Tonight, we have with us, Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Mr Daren Tang, and as you can see, he is seeking re-election for a second term in 2026.

{:start="3"}
3.	When Singapore nominated Daren in 2019 for his first term as Director General of WIPO, it was the first time we had done so, the first time we nominated a Singaporean for a leadership position in a major UN body.

{:start="4"}
4.	We did so after very serious and careful consideration, and eventually we decided to proceed because we realised at that time, that we had in Daren, someone who we were happy and proud to put forward. More importantly, we did so because of Singapore, our country’s firm commitment to the multilateral system. Multilateral systems underpin global efforts to protect and advance global commons. 

{:start="5"}
5.	We were, of course, fully convinced, that Daren will be totally dedicated to promoting inclusive global cooperation, and also drive global priorities resolutely amidst very complex geo-political and geo-economic landscapes. We thought so five years ago, and I think five years on, that sentiment is still very much relevant and pertinent to the way in which we make that calculation.

{:start="6"}
6.	I am very grateful for the strong expressions of support for Daren and his vision for WIPO over the past five years. 

{:start="7"}
7.	I believe that all of you will agree with me that since taking office in October 2020, Daren has worked really hard, tirelessly to transform the global IP system, to make IP not just a concept, not just a legal principle, but really, a catalyst for jobs, for investments, for enterprise growth and economic development for all Member States. 

{:start="8"}
8.	Daren has also been leading WIPO to demystify IP for laypersons, to ensure that IP is not just for some at the end of the spectrum, but for all across the spectrum. He has expanded WIPO’s efforts to support innovators and creators around the world. For example, WIPO Academy – as the world’s largest IP training institute – has equipped over 600,000 persons in the past five years with IP knowledge and skills. Of which, 400,000 of them were youths, 300,000 were women, and 80% were from developing countries, using IP as a tool, as a lever to level up, to ensure that we lift as much of the bottom of the base as possible, to ensure that there is inclusive growth for all. 

{:start="9"}
9.	Beyond capacity-building, WIPO has delivered on many impact-driven projects to a range of different beneficiaries, from Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), to women and youth innovators as well as creators.

{:start="10"}
10.	Above all, if I know Daren, and I do because we were in school together many years ago. I can assure you of Daren’s commitment,  enthusiasm and wholeheartedness, and I think fundamentally beyond competence, what we're looking for in this world order today, is someone who's driven by passion, driven by their commitment to make a change and to use the tools that he has, using intellectual property as their driver of change. 

{:start="11"}
11.	Under Daren’s leadership and the strong support of all of you, WIPO successfully concluded two treaties in 2024. Why is that significant? Well, let me just tell you about the two treaties.

{:start="12"}
12.	The first is the Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (GRATK) as well as the Riyadh Design Law Treaty (RDLT). Why is this significant? Well, think about this. The last WIPO treaty prior to this was concluded over a decade ago. Daren, with his convening ability, the ability to bring people together - it's not just about pushing forward but making sure everyone comes along with the general - to be able to conclude both of these treaties, was no mean feat. I think that reflects the ability to bring people together, to convene, as well as to move forward collectively.

{:start="13"}
13.	Fundamentally, the vision is for WIPO to serve as a shining beacon for multilateralism, which I think you will agree is critically important at this time when the post-World War II international order is really under severe stress. 

{:start="14"}
14.	I believe that WIPO is testimony that international organisations remain relevant today. When grounded in shared values and mutual respect, and led by effective leaders, it can and will deliver outcomes that benefit all Member States and their people.

{:start="15"}
15.	Equally important, Daren has initiated organisational transformation efforts to build a more open, collaborative and consultative WIPO. 

{:start="16"}
16.	At the same time, Daren has continued to emphasise good governance and maintain the strong financial health of WIPO, and that's important.  However much change you want to make around the world, you've got to ensure that the core is strong, governance is transparent, and WIPO is run efficiently and capably.

{:start="17"}
17.	At the end of the day, I must say that my country, Singapore, is gratified and honoured by the overwhelming support and positive commendations for Daren’s first term as WIPO DG. 

{:start="18"}
18.	We are proud, we are honoured, and we are very grateful. We are also encouraged for the many early expressions of support that we have received from our friends, including within ASEAN, from the African Group, from Belgium, France, Japan, Qatar, the UAE and several others.

{:start="19"}
19.	We look forward to your government’s continued support for Daren and his second term, so that he can continue the transformational journey and the impact that WIPO has made since he started on this journey in 2020.

{:start="20"}
20.	I want to thank once again, all of you for your presence, your presence deeply honours us.  I would like to go around later on, to chat with each of you and to find out and catch up with each of you in your parts of the world. Once again before Daren takes the stage, thank you very much, and I hope you enjoy a very lovely evening.
