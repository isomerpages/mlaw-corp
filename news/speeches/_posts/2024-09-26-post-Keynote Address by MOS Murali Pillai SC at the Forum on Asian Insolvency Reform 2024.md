Honourable Judges,

Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

<b>A. Introduction</b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp; A very good morning to each and every one of you.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp; Before this event started, I had an opportunity to speak to some of you. A special welcome to those of you who have travelled to Singapore, especially some that have come from afar. The weather has not been so kind today, but you have braved the tropical thunderstorm. It is fair to say that your attendance at FAIR shows that there are no fair-weathered friends!

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp; It is my honour to deliver the Keynote Address at this year’s Forum on Asian Insolvency Reform, or “FAIR” for short, and I am delighted to welcome you to Singapore for this forum.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp; I gather that this is an august gathering of thought leaders, here to talk about ideas of how to make the insolvency system better. I mentioned to Ms Julia Fraser from the World Bank that her Welcome Remarks set the stage very well on economic trends in Asia, debt levels, and how the insolvency systems can improve.

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp; This is the first FAIR to be held in-person since 2018.

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that the speakers and attendees hail from over 20 jurisdictions, which promises a vibrant exchange of views.

<b>B. Broad Economic Trends</b>

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp; The theme of FAIR this year is "Innovating insolvency in a transforming Asia".

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp; On the latter part of this theme – transforming Asia – it is an undoubted fact that Asia’s economy is growing and transforming rapidly. Sometimes it goes down in the near term, but in the long-term, the trend is up.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp; Whilst global economic growth is expected to continue being weak and subdued in the coming years by historic standards, the Asia-Pacific region is projected to continue growing at a faster pace than the rest of the world.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(a)&nbsp; The International Monetary Fund forecasts that the global economy will grow by 3.2% in 2024; Asia and the Pacific regions will grow at a greater pace of 4.5%.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>

<p></p><p style="margin-left: 60px">
(b)&nbsp; This is further underscored by the fact that these regions are expected to contribute 60% of global economic growth in 2024.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>

{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp; In our immediate vicinity, ASEAN economies continue to grow rapidly.

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(a)&nbsp; Based on ASEAN’s total GDP of US$ 3.6 trillion in 2022, ASEAN was the world’s fifth-largest economy.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

<p></p><p style="margin-left: 60px">
(b)&nbsp; Looking ahead, there are estimates that project ASEAN’s GDP to grow to US$ 4.5 trillion by 2030.</p>

<p></p><p style="margin-left: 60px">
(c)&nbsp; This would propel ASEAN to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in just six more years.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup></p>

{:start="11"}
11.&nbsp; While the long-term trajectory is positive, there are challenges and uncertainties in the road ahead.

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(a)&nbsp; Ongoing geopolitical tensions such as the conflicts in the Middle East and in Europe; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(b)&nbsp; Geoeconomic fragmentation, including trade tensions.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p>

{:start="12"}
12.&nbsp; Besides these near-term risks, economies will also have to grapple with major transformative shifts that will fundamentally alter the business landscape.

{:start="13"}
13.&nbsp; I will briefly mention the digital and green transformations.

{:start="14"}
14.&nbsp; Globally, the digital transformation has accelerated in recent years, driven in part by the Covid-19 pandemic. This has changed, and will continue to shape, the way we live and work, including how we do business.

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(a)&nbsp; Businesses are increasingly using new technologies in their operations to drive productivity and growth.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 140px">
(i)&nbsp; For instance, artificial intelligence tools can assist finance professionals with crunching and analysing large amounts of data to spot credit risks or other issues of concern, which would have otherwise required significant manual effort.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup></p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(b)&nbsp; Businesses, in particular the smaller ones, are now better able to expand their outreach across borders, by using technology and online platforms.</p>
