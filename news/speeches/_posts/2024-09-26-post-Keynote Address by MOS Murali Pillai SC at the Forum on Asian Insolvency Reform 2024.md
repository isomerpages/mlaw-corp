Honourable Judges,

Distinguished Guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

<b>A. Introduction</b>

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp; A very good morning to each and every one of you.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp; Before this event started, I had an opportunity to speak to some of you. A special welcome to those of you who have travelled to Singapore, especially some that have come from afar. The weather has not been so kind today, but you have braved the tropical thunderstorm. It is fair to say that your attendance at FAIR shows that there are no fair-weathered friends!

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp; It is my honour to deliver the Keynote Address at this year’s Forum on Asian Insolvency Reform, or “FAIR” for short, and I am delighted to welcome you to Singapore for this forum.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp; I gather that this is an august gathering of thought leaders, here to talk about ideas of how to make the insolvency system better. I mentioned to Ms Julia Fraser from the World Bank that her Welcome Remarks set the stage very well on economic trends in Asia, debt levels, and how the insolvency systems can improve.

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp; This is the first FAIR to be held in-person since 2018.

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp; I am pleased to note that the speakers and attendees hail from over 20 jurisdictions, which promises a vibrant exchange of views.

<b>B. Broad Economic Trends</b>

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp; The theme of FAIR this year is "Innovating insolvency in a transforming Asia".

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp; On the latter part of this theme – transforming Asia – it is an undoubted fact that Asia’s economy is growing and transforming rapidly. Sometimes it goes down in the near term, but in the long-term, the trend is up.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp; Whilst global economic growth is expected to continue being weak and subdued in the coming years by historic standards, the Asia\-Pacific region is projected to continue growing at a faster pace than the rest of the world.[\[1\]](#_ftn1)

(a)&nbsp; The International Monetary Fund forecasts that the global economy will grow by 3.2% in 2024; Asia and the Pacific regions will grow at a greater pace of 4.5%.

(b)&nbsp; You have in the Middle East, another war which threatens repeatedly to escalate into a broader, all-out conflict.</p>

<b>Singapore’s Approach</b>



<b>Singapore Convention On Mediation</b>



{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp; Today, there are 57 signatories, which is quite significant within five years given that we had lost a couple of years to the pandemic. That includes some of the world’s major economies, like the United States, China and India. 14 countries have ratified the Convention, including Japan, Saudi Arabia, and most recently, Sri Lanka.&nbsp;

{:start="11"}
11.&nbsp; We hope to build on this momentum to have more countries come on board.&nbsp;

{:start="12"}
12.&nbsp; The Convention is just one example of trying to encourage that. But it shows you what we can do, working together, coming together, and exchanging viewpoints.&nbsp;

<b>Conclusion</b>

{:start="13"}
13.&nbsp; On that note, let me thank:

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(i)&nbsp; UNCITRAL and our partner organisations for working with the Ministry of Law to put together the very impressive lineup of events for this Conference, and the rest of the week.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(ii)&nbsp; Speakers for coming to share your experiences and expertise; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 60px">
(iii)&nbsp; All participants for taking time to be with us, especially those who have come from afar.</p>

{:start="14"}
14.&nbsp; Thank you very much.
