Your Excellency Union Attorney General Dr Tun Shin  
Distinguished guests  
Ladies and Gentlemen  

1. *Mingalabar!* I would first like to thank everyone for the very warm welcome that you have shown to me and the Singapore delegation. As soon as we landed in Myanmar, we were touched by the very sincere hospitality shown by the Myanmar people and we are deeply appreciative that you have taken time to host us during this Thadingyut period, the Myanmar Festival of Lights, which we know is one of your more important festivals. We would therefore like to extend our heartfelt thanks to His Excellency, Dr Tun Shin, U Kyaw San and the officers in the Union Attorney General’s Office for hosting us and helping to facilitate the arrangements for this Commercial Law Workshop in Nay Pyi Taw.


2. I would also like to thank the Attorney General this morning for giving us an overview of the steps that Myanmar has taken in opening up its laws and its markets. We see that there would be a great opportunity for collaboration and interaction between Singapore and Myanmar and this commercial law workshop is a step in that direction.


3. Over the next two days, the experts here will share their knowledge on a variety of Commercial Law topics. They range from contract law and principles to the practical application of contracts in the area of private-public partnerships and infrastructure development, specifically in Construction law. These areas will provide the legal framework for the successful development and growth of the economy.


4. I am also delighted that Mr Lok Vi Ming (the President of the Law Society of Singapore), Ms Shannon Tan, Mr Kenneth Lim and Ms Goh Wanjing will have the chance at this workshop to share and interact with the participants of their experiences as practitioners. I also hope that this workshop will present opportunities for Singapore to find out more about Myanmar’s legal landscape through the exchanges between the workshop participants and our lawyers andwe look forward to both sides having an enriching and useful exchange.


5. The Commercial Law Workshop is the first jointly organized event by Myanmar’s Union Attorney General’s Office, Singapore’s Ministry of Law and the Law Society of Singapore. I am confident that this workshop will be the first of many occasions for sharing and interaction between the legal fraternities of our countries and through these interactions, we hope to cultivate long-lasting relationships between the legal fraternities in Myanmar and Singapore.


6. So, on this note, may I wish the workshop every success and I look forward to a fruitful session ahead. Thank you!
