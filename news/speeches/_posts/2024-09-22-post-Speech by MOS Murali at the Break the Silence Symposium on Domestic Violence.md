Partners,

Distinguished guests,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

{:start="1"}&nbsp;1. I am happy to be here amongst friends, and I would like to acknowledge the presence of Mdm Susila Ganesan, retired judge Mr Bala Reddy and Associate Professor Narayanan Ganapathy, amongst others. Really happy to be amongst friends to discuss this very important topic. I am very encouraged to see quite a couple of you here today for the “Break the Silence” symposium, united against the scourge of domestic violence. Your presence here this morning is a resounding affirmation of the idea that every individual has the right to live a life free from violence, especially from those closest to them. As PM Lawrence Wong has said, families are the cornerstone and bedrock of our society. Families are our primary support system. When our families flourish, so too does our community and, our nation too.

<b>Domestic Violence is No Private Matter</b>

{:start="2"} 2. Domestic violence is often shrouded in secrecy. But we should never accept it as a private issue. On the contrary, it is a societal ill that requires our collective efforts to address.

{:start="3"} 3. While the prevalence of domestic violence in Singapore is lower than global rates, it continues to be a concern because one case is one case too many. A 2019 review by the National Council of Social Service estimated that about 3% of Singapore’s population – including both male and females - experienced some form of domestic violence based on administrative data.

{:start="4"} 4. Domestic violence can happen to anyone, regardless of age, race, sex, or socio-economic status. No community is safe or immune to this; this issue is not unique to the Indian community; nor to Singapore.

{:start="5"} 5. Which is why we should all regard stepping in to protect someone from domestic violence as a civic duty; not just a private moral choice. If each and every Singaporean took it upon themselves to intervene when witnessing abuse, I believe it would contribute to making Singapore a better place for families. It would be a reflection of our broader ethos, that violence in any form must not be tolerated – especially where vulnerable victims are impacted.

{:start="6"} 6. This is why the Government had amended the Protection from Harassment Act in 2019 to, amongst other things, double the prescribed punishment for offences under POHA committed against vulnerable persons and persons in intimate relationships. We also amended the Penal Code in 2019 to enhance protections for vulnerable victims by, for example, introducing new offences under the Penal Code to target persons in same households who failed to protect vulnerable victims from abuse and whose inaction allowed the abuse to continue.

{:start="7"} 7. In addition, the Maintenance of Parents Act was amended in 2023 to provide, amongst others, that parents with records of abuse against their children must seek the permission of the Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents before proceeding with their claim. This recognises the serious harm a child can suffer at the hands of an abusive parent. This is something that I got to know of because I was involved in the amendment process, and some of the cases that I have come across can really cause sleepless nights.

{:start="8"} 8. The Government has also made it easier for the community to report violence. In 2021, MSF introduced the 24-hour National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline. It received 8,400 and 10,800 calls in 2021 and 2022 respectively – so on average about 9,000+ calls; not a small number. Furthermore, the Domestic Violence Emergency Response Team, or DVERT was established last year. Social service professionals respond jointly with the Police to provide rapid, coordinated responses to high-risk domestic violence cases with immediate safety concerns, ensuring immediate support and protection for survivors whilst working towards a long-term solution.

{:start="9"} 9. Prompt reporting can be life-saving and can facilitate swift access to professional support. We want to work towards a society where survivors are protected and empowered to seek help, and where offenders are not only held accountable but also provided with the avenues for rehabilitation to prevent the recurrence of such acts.

<b>Enhanced Legislation to Empower Survivors and Strengthen Rehabilitation Efforts</b>

{:start="10"} 10. The Government has also taken more decisive action to ensure that the legal framework is updated to deal effectively with family violence. We amended the Women's Charter last year, to strengthen the measures against family violence. These include amendments to make clearer that the definition of family violence covers physical, sexual, emotional and psychological abuse, and that abuse can take the form of a single instance of conduct or behaviour, or a course of conduct or behaviour.

{:start="11"} 11. The amendments can be categorised under three focal areas: (1) empowering family violence survivors to better protect themselves; (2) strengthening the Government’s ability to intervene in family violence cases; and (3) strengthening the rehabilitation of the perpetrators.

{:start="12"} 12. <u>First, on empowering survivors</u>: Survivors of family violence will be able to avail themselves of stronger protective measures. The Family Justice Courts will be able to make new orders such as the Stay Away Order – which prohibits the perpetrator from being in the vicinity of the survivor – and the No Contact Order – which prohibits the perpetrator from visiting or communicating with the survivor.

{:start="13"} 13. <u>Second, on strengthening the government’s ability to intervene</u>: Protectors will be able to apply for Personal Protection Orders (PPOs) on behalf of survivors under specific circumstances, without the need for their consent. This is in recognition of exceptional circumstances where survivors of family violence are unwilling to apply for PPOs, often due to the influence that their abusers have over them or because they wish to preserve the relationship with their abuser. And we see this on the ground. Additionally, in exceptional cases, Protectors will be able to apply to the Court for the electronic monitoring of high-risk perpetrators and to remove survivors from their homes for their safety, as a last resort.

{:start="14"} 14. <u>Third, on strengthening the rehabilitation of perpetrators</u>: The scope of existing counselling orders will be expanded to include treatments and interventions, such as parenting programmes, family therapy and caregiving training. The Court will also be empowered to mandate treatment for perpetrators with psychiatric conditions contributing to family violence. The penalties for breaches of court orders in family violence cases were also raised.

{:start="15"} 15. These are major changes, which will come into force by the end of this year. They represent the Government’s strong commitment to stamping out domestic violence in all its forms.

<b>Whole-of-Society Effort to Tackle Domestic Violence</b>

{:start="16"} 16. However, legislation alone is not a panacea, and I think all of us here recognise that. It takes a concerted effort from all of society to protect the vulnerable, and eradicate domestic violence. It is our collective responsibility to reinforce the message that the home should be a sanctuary characterised by respect and safety, and free from the shadow of abuse. I thus commend the key partners collaborating with MSF on the Break the Silence campaign, such as Casa Raudha Ltd and Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities and in particular, SINDA.

{:start="17"} 17. I would like to take a moment to recognise the invaluable work of SINDA, in supporting families in the Indian community. Their tireless efforts have been instrumental in addressing themes that are often less spoken about, including the sensitive issue of domestic violence. SINDA has been providing support services, counselling and educational programmes that strengthen Indian families and promote respectful relationships. Through initiatives like Dad’s Journey, Group Work with the vulnerable, and Positive Parenting Workshops, as well as Mental Wellness Workshops, SINDA has demonstrated its commitment to strengthen family relationships and offering a lifeline to those in need through casework and counselling. The dedication of SINDA’s volunteers and professionals in reaching out to vulnerable families, providing culturally sensitive support, and fostering a safe environment for victims to seek help is truly commendable.

{:start="18"} 18. Apart from breaking the silence, we must also focus on breaking the cycle of violence. After ensuring safety and protection for survivors, perpetrators would need to be supported in their rehabilitation journey. With appropriate support and intervention, perpetrators can learn other ways to better manage their emotions and behaviours, and avoid harming their loved ones.

{:start="19"} 19. Addressing domestic abuse effectively requires a sustained collective effort and commitment. By championing this cause within your spheres of influence, developing targeted initiatives, and fostering a culture of zero tolerance for abuse, you can drive meaningful change from the ground up. Together, we can create a community where domestic violence is neither hidden nor tolerated, but actively addressed and prevented.

{:start="20"} 20. As community leaders, you have a unique opportunity to be catalysts for change. Let us work together to amplify awareness of and support existing initiatives, as well as create a culture of zero tolerance for domestic violence. Crucially, let us ensure that those who need help know where to turn to in terms of our National Anti-violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline (or NAVH), Protection Specialist Centres such as PAVE, counselling or mental health services, Crisis Shelter such as Casa Raudha Women’s Home, or legal aid agencies such as the Legal Aid Bureau or ProBono SG.

{:start="21"} 21. Today, we are privileged to hear from Mr Ganeson, whose journey is nothing short of inspiring. Mr Ganeson will be sharing about how he restored his family relationships and how he is now actively helping other people who caused harm on their own personal recovery journeys. His transformation and dedication to aiding others in their rehabilitation is a powerful testament to the possibility of change and the importance of upholding dignity and safety in our families.

<b>Conclusion</b>

{:start="22"} 22. In conclusion, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the organisers, MSF, SINDA, the Hindu Endowment Board, Thye Hua Kwan and Casa Raudha for making today’s event possible. I hope that today will spark a series of meaningful dialogues, sharing of insights, and collaborative strategies to combat domestic violence. Together, we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of those affected, and I look forward to the positive impact that our collective efforts will bring.

{:start="23"} 23. Thank you.
