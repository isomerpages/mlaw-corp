**Copyright Licensing &amp; Administration Society of Singapore (CLASS) CEO Mr Andrew Fong**

**CLASS Chairman Mr Alban Kang**

**Ladies and Gentlemen**

**Introduction**

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good evening to all of you. It is a real honour and privilege to be able to join you to celebrate CLASS’s Silver Jubilee.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I was thinking about the work that you do and the work that I do in both my portfolios in the ministries, I think there is a common thread. When I put on my MCCY hat, I look at promoting culture, making sure that we have the best writers, the best artists, that they do the best work, that they continue to thrive and be able to pursue their passion and see their passion become a career.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In many ways, the work that you do supports all of that. Because in order for all of that to happen, you have to champion a respect for copyright. I am very happy to be here celebrating the 25th anniversary with you, because we have a common cause to try to ensure that we respect, protect and, in some ways, enforce copyright.

**Honouring CLASS’ Journey and Achievements**

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, 25 years ago, when CLASS was first founded, it was precisely with this vision to safeguard published works from intellectual property theft.&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am told that CLASS was started by 10 publishers and 4 authors, together with then-CEO, Mr Paul Wee, whom I am told, had an office in a borrowed space from a publisher member’s office. But look at what CLASS has grown into. CLASS has grown because there is a strong need, strong common cause, and strong belief among CLASS members that there is something to fight for. It is with this strong foundation that we can continue to nurture the growth of our publications in our publishing industry.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From starting out small to reaching this significant milestone, it is quite evident that CLASS has exemplified excellence in a very strong, heartfelt, steadfast commitment to its vision.</p>

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the years, CLASS has played a pivotal role in promoting copyright in Singapore.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From advocating the rights of creators to fostering a culture of respect for copyright, CLASS has been at the forefront of championing the interests of publishers and authors. By doing so, by championing the interests of publishers and authors, and protecting the copyright, you will protect and lift standards of their work as well.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLASS is also actively involved in the work of the International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations (IFRRO) and thanks to Andrew, I found out that Singapore will be hosting an IFRRO event in 2025. That is a significant milestone and also a recognition not just of Singapore, but also the important work that CLASS has done, that IFFRO members will gather here in Singapore. The work that you are involved in with IFFRO is to assist rights holders on how to use the copyright. Some may really just be publishers, writers, artists, and may not be entirely familiar with the rights that they own and have. So, the role you play helps them to understand, and therefore protect their rights.</p>

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we commemorate this important milestone, I wish to acknowledge the invaluable contributions of those who have been part of CLASS's journey – today, and also in the past. From its founders and leaders to its many dedicated staff and members. Each one of you has played a vital role in shaping CLASS to become what it is today.

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heartiest congratulations to all of you on this remarkable journey from one person and a small office to the organisation that you now have become!

**Looking ahead: CLASS’ Role in Fostering a Thriving Literary Community**

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides promoting the importance of copyright, CLASS’s contributions have also gone beyond just making sure that you support, respect and protect copyright. It now goes beyond supporting publishers and authors, and extends to giving back to society through various corporate social responsibility initiatives.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLASS has rolled out meaningful initiatives such as:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CLASS Bursary Award that supports needy students and motivates them to excel academically, which I had the pleasure of joining the virtual award ceremony three years ago in 2021; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Copyright School Challenge that encourages creativity and promotes copyright awareness among students through creative writing and video making competitions.</p>

{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These initiatives are simple, but they serve to inspire our students to write and express their creative thoughts, and also raise awareness of the importance of literature in our society. I think this is something that, with the digital age and with social media, we lose the ability to write and read, and we lose the ability to appreciate good writing. I hope that we can come back to it at some point. I have always enjoyed reading. There is a world of difference between reading for information and reading for pleasure and appreciation. All of you in this room probably know better than I do that significant difference, and the impact it can make on you when you read an article or a journal or a piece that is well-written, well-articulated, with imagery and with imagination. It really gives you not just information, but it gives you a lot of thought-provoking appreciation as well.

{:start="11"}
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, a thriving literary community holds immense cultural, educational, and also socio-economic value for Singapore.&nbsp;

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Literature as a medium preserves and transmits our cultural heritage. It is a repository of our knowledge, our beliefs, our values, our practices, and our rituals, passed down through generations. This ensures that future generations can continue to learn about and connect with their cultural roots.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our literature and our writings help us to preserve that very special privilege and allow it to be passed on from one generation to another. Through literature, we are exposed to different perspectives. We read about different lifestyles, different viewpoints, and different experiences that we ourselves may not encounter in our everyday lives. But it gives us a more holistic picture about the people we live amongst, and the place that we call home.&nbsp; It is a great educational resource that helps us strengthen knowledge and empathy that are really useful in navigating today’s increasingly interconnected world. Today’s world is highly digital, highly interconnected, but sometimes that connection does not lead to communication. That is what literature can do for us.</p>
	
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Literature also contributes to our economy and society - beyond the hard indicators of value-added and employment numbers, it really adds to Singapore’s vibrancy and liveability.</p>

**Launch of the** **CLASS-** **Singapore Book Council** **Writer’s Grant**

{:start="12"}
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with CLASS’s commitment to nurturing local talent and fostering a vibrant literary landscape, I am delighted to announce the launch of the Writer’s Grant by CLASS and the Singapore Book Council.&nbsp;

{:start="13"}
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Writer’s Grant aims to provide financial support for local writers and translators, empowering them to pursue their creative endeavours whilst awaiting the publication of their manuscripts.

{:start="14"}
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a total commitment of $150,000 over three years, this grant underscores CLASS’s as well as the Singapore Book Council’s dedication and commitment to supporting the literary community in Singapore. Details on guidelines as well as the application procedures will be made available in September this year.

**Conclusion**

{:start="15"}
15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In closing, let me once again express my heartfelt congratulations to CLASS on this very momentous occasion.

{:start="16"}
16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward to your 50th anniversary. May the years ahead between now and 50 years and beyond be even more fulfilling and rewarding for you as you journey towards a future where intellectual property rights are respected. People first of all must know about it, understand it and then respect and upheld it, because this allows the creative side of Singapore to flourish, and allow innovation to thrive.

{:start="17"}
17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you once again and congratulations. I look forward to meeting all of you this evening.
