Ms Stefanie Yuen-Thio, Chair, SG Her Empowerment

My colleagues – MOS Sun Xueling, SPS Rahayu Mazam and MP Yeo Wan Ling

Ladies and gentlemen

Good morning.

{:start="1"}
1.  I am going to talk to you about some of the things some of you did over a fair number of years How we have moved over the years, what has happened, why are we having this conference, why do we need to go through this repeatedly? It is because, as I said in 2020 when we talked about this, a second major push towards payments from (xx).
    
{:start="2"}
2.  It’s the easier part of all the quantitative things – better education, better employment. You can measure, you can move, you can get things done. The harder part is getting the mindset change in society. Getting the mindset change, not just among men but amongst women too, is what all of this means.&nbsp;

{:start="3"}
3.  What does equality mean, what does progress for women mean and how do you achieve that? That social and mindset change is not an easy thing to achieve and it can only be done if we repeatedly come back to the topic, year after year periodically, otherwise you make a speech or have an event, it will go away and it gets forgotten.

{:start="4"}
4.  So SHE, AWARE and the other organisations are involved in this very noble and important area. For us, our only resource is human resources. If we do not maximise the potential of our women, you will lose 50 per cent and we cannot afford that. That is from the economic perspective but from the perspective of what is right and wrong, you just got to make sure that everyone has the idea that women and men in society should move along in a way that is mutually respectful and equal.
  
{:start="5"}
5.  So I thank SHE for inviting me here today. This conference came out of a conversation I had with Stefanie and her people and it is an opportunity for us to talk about women.

{:start="6"}
6.  Last year, the Government issued the White Paper on Singapore Women’s Development. That was the culmination of the year long Conversation on Singapore Women’s Development, which I launched in September 2020.

{:start="7"}
7.  When the White Paper was issued, I said its recommendations are a “guidepost”, not the “endpoint” of our aspirations for women in Singapore.&nbsp;&nbsp;

{:start="8"}
8.  So how are you going to do it? It has got to be a variety of ways. One of the ways is to bring stakeholders together like today, across the public and private sectors, carrying on the important dialogue. Carry on talking about it, pushing, making changes and you will in parallel with the conversations that very substantive changes have been taking place, which not a lot of people are aware of.

{:start="9"}
9.  If you see the major legislative changes that have taken place and you have heard a little bit from Stefanie earlier, but I will touch on it later as well. You will see there is a complete (xx) change in (xx).

**ENCOURAGING THE RIGHT MINDSET: GOOD LAWS**

{:start="10"}
10.  So starting with the right mindset.

{:start="11"}
11.  Women may face bias, stereotypes, obstacles, perceptions and practices which have formed over generations, in all societies, and we are not going to be able to change that overnight. But how do we encourage the right mindset? It takes continuous effort in education, introspection and legal framework.&nbsp;

{:start="12"}
12.  If you look at education – at home, in schools, among social circles and in the wider community. We have to raise the awareness on women’s issues, set good examples for others to follow and change the tone of society.&nbsp;
  
{:start="13"}
13.  Second, we must not shy away from introspection. We should continually reflect on how we do things, question if they are fair and inclusive towards women, and make the system better even if there is some resistance.&nbsp;

{:start="14"}
14.  Third, it is the legal framework and that is my focus because of that I am. My own belief is that the laws cannot make you a better person. The laws cannot make you change your mindset when we give you a framework of what you cannot do. Once you set the framework of what you cannot do, what you can do is something that Government agencies and the community can work together to create. Therefore, it sets a framework on what kind of society we want to live in.

{:start="15"}
15.  Laws also help build shared norms, on this particular subject, how we treat and respect women. The starting point to me, and I had said this numerous times, the Women’s Charter is an excellent example. This was a landmark piece of legislation for women’s development in Singapore. It was enacted in 1961. At the time, many parents did not send their daughters to school. As a result, not many women were employed and if they worked, it was usually in informal jobs earning much less than men. You can take a look at this slide on the oral history interview with Chua Hui Neo. At the same time, men could take multiple wives. Polygamy was commonplace.
 
{:start="16"}
16.  Some of you may be familiar with Chan Choy Siong. She was a strong advocate for women’s rights, a pioneer. In 1956, she formed the PAP Women’s League, which is the precursor of today’s PAP’s Women’s Wing. When she rose in support of the Women’s Charter in Parliament, she said “Women in our society are like pieces of meat put on the table for men to slice.” Very graphic but that gives you a sense of what society was like before, in pre-independent Singapore in the 1950s.&nbsp;&nbsp;

{:start="17"}
17.  The Women’s Charter was hugely influential in changing things. It put society on a different footing. It provided for monogamous marriage. It recognised a wife’s right to engage in any trade or profession, own property, and that she had equal rights as her husband, in the running of the matrimonial household. It set out the rules for divorce and the maintenance of wives and children. It also strengthened the laws relating to offences against women and girls.&nbsp;

{:start="18"}
18.  Since the Women’s Charter, we have continued to promote and strengthen women’s rights through the legal system. I will touch on some of the more recent legislative changes, in two areas – one, in terms of protecting women against harm and violence, and two, supporting women and families during marital breakdown.&nbsp; I watch these two areas closely as they involve my two Ministries – the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Ministry of Law (MinLaw).&nbsp;
    
**LAWS PROTECTING WOMEN AGAINST HARM &amp; VIOLENCE**

{:start="19"}
19.  Let me start with the first area. We are, on the whole, in a good position, in terms of the safety and security of women in Singapore. A 2018 public perception survey by SPF showed that 93 per cent of our women feel safe in Singapore. In the 2020 Gallup Law &amp; Order Survey, 97 per cent of Singapore residents feel safe walking alone on the streets at night, including women. It is the highest in the world. For an urban center to achieve that, it is actually quite exceptional. Our legal framework, the way we enforce our laws and the way the norms of society were established, all contribute to this.
    
{:start="20"}
20.  Let me give you a few examples of the changes in the laws, which help to give better protection to women in the last few years. In 2016, the Women’s Charter was amended to better support vulnerable women and girls in family violence and crisis situations. The changes allowed for these vulnerable females to be placed in the care of “fit individuals”. This can be a relative or friend providing support in a “home environment”, instead of in residential facilities or shelters.

{:start="21"}
21.  In 2018, changes were made to the Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act to reduce the trauma for sexual victims participating in the criminal justice process.&nbsp;
 
{:start="22"}
22.  For example, if there is a sexual assault or rape trial, the victim, who is usually a woman, will have to go to court and face up to the very person whom she says had assaulted her. We now allow the hearings to be conducted behind closed doors and we changed the laws to prevent counsel from asking certain types of questions. For example, the question of whether there was sexual assault in a case, it is really irrelevant how many other men the victim may have slept with in the past. In the past, from Victorian times I suppose, the Penal Code said that counsels can ask you who else you had slept with because if you are a “loose woman” then your (xx) cannot be (xx) upon, so we changed that.

{:start="23"}
23.  In 2019, the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) was amended. The process for obtaining Protection Orders was streamlined, making it easier and faster to seek relief if you do not want to go through the criminal process system. Usually, women are the victims. It is easier now to go in there, get an order and get the platforms to take the matter down, if it is an image or other stuff that a former partner or somebody else has put up.&nbsp;

{:start="24"}
24.  At the same time, we amended the POHA and the Penal Code to give better protection to victims of intimate partner violence. This is important because in the past, only married persons could get protection from violence in a partnership context. If anyone assaults anyone, it is an offence but (xx). If you are in a relationship with a partner and they threaten you, if you are a married person you will get better rights, and if you are an unmarried person you will not get as much. So now we allow unmarried persons to quality for protection against family violence under the Women’s Charter. While it is gender neutral, it is usually women.&nbsp;

{:start="25"}
25.  When I moved the Bill to amend the Penal Code, I gave the example of a lady named Cindy. She had suffered horrific abuse from her live-in partner, almost daily, over eight years. When the Police found her, she was almost completely blind. She had slash wounds all over her body and with broken bones. All this witnessed by the two young children she had with the abuser.

{:start="26"}
26.  With our changes to the law, women like Cindy can now apply for a Protection Order under POHA, and people like her abuser will face twice the maximum penalties that are normally prescribed for such offences. But if I may add, it is not just for (xx) but often women in such situations are well-educated. They can be lawyers, doctors, and they can know their rights, but they still do not seem to be able to get out of that situation. So that, you will find, is the most difficult, and they need to be given encouragement. We need to empower our NGOs and the officers to move in and give them moral support to step out of it, and move out of the influence of the abuser so that they can then be told of their rights and perhaps be persuaded to get out of the abusive relationship once and for all.

{:start="27"}
27.  In 2020, we abolished marital immunity for rape in the Penal Code. A woman’s body is her own and that should not change, when she marries. No still means no. The law now makes that clear.&nbsp;

{:start="28"}
28.  Most recently, a few weeks ago, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) passed amendments to the Women’s Charter, to strengthen protection for victims of family violence. These are usually women and the proportion is roughly three to one currently. I found that surprising because I did not think 25 per cent of men were being abused by women. For example, the definition of family violence was updated to make clear that it includes physical, sexual, emotional and psychological abuse.&nbsp;

{:start="29"}
29.  Emotional and psychological abuse can arise from controlling behaviours, such as when perpetrators threaten to withhold monthly allowances from their spouses; or constantly call their spouses to check on their whereabouts and isolate them from their family and friends.

{:start="30"}
30.  Again, I emphasise that even though this is the law, it does not mean that all the women understand it and will take advantage of it, so bringing it to the ground is going to be extremely important. We need to educate and get the women to understand that there are these rights. We need to have touch points within the community so that they know.&nbsp;

{:start="31"}
31.  I do not want to increase the number of divorces or marital (xx), but I think it is important that people recognise when they are being abused and know that there are ways in which they can take care of themselves. That is important and help needs to be nearby.

{:start="32"}
32.  The amendments also allow the Court to make additional rehabilitative orders, raise penalties, and strengthen enforcement against breaches of Court orders.

{:start="33"}
33.  This framework is to make clear – we have zero tolerance against violence or harm of any kind against women. That is a fundamental value for us, and those who act contrary to this fundamental value, they will be held to account.&nbsp;

{:start="34"}
34.  And to support these laws, we also continually explore new ways at the operational level, to facilitate the reporting of sexual crimes and family violence.

{:start="35"}
35.  These are some recent examples. Last year, MSF enhanced the National Anti-Violence and Sexual Harassment Helpline. It now includes an online channel, as an additional mode of reporting. (We have online reporting channels, as well as a new Sexual Crime and Family Violence Command set up by the Police.)

{:start="36"}
36.  This year, SPF has formed a new Sexual Crime and Family Violence Command. The officers are specially trained to deal with sexual crime and family violence cases, and also in victim management skills. Since April, SPF has also progressively rolled out a “Sexual Crime Report” option at queue management kiosks at NPCs. Victims selecting this option will be given priority and privacy, when they come forward to report incidents. You also have the “Sexual Crime Report” option at the NPCs’ kiosks. When you go to the police station, you do not want to be in a queue and talk in public about what happened, while in line with everybody else who might be there.&nbsp;

{:start="37"}
37.  The One-Stop Abuse Forensic Examination Centre (OneSAFE Centre) has also been revamped and was opened in April. It has an improved design, that aims to provide victims with more privacy and comfort during the investigation process; and new medical rooms to increase the capacity for forensic medical examinations.&nbsp;

{:start="38"}
38.  There is also the One-Stop Abuse Forensic Examination Centre (OneSAFE Centre), this I talked about previously. In the past, you go to the hospital or you go to report the police, you tell your story, then you go to the hospital to tell your story again, and then later on you tell your story again. We try and make it a one stop centre where the doctor, the police officer and everyone else is there. Evidence can even be video recorded so that if you do not want to go back to it, in some cases, we can use that video as evidence. So you say your story once and you do not get your trauma repeated over and over again.

**LAWS SUPPORTING WOMEN &amp; FAMILIES IN THE CONTEXT OF MARITAL BREAKDOWN**

{:start="39"}
39.  Let me now turn to the second area – supporting women and families in the context of marital breakdown.&nbsp;

{:start="40"}
40.  In 2015, we introduced the Simplified Divorce Track, for cases where parties agree on the ground for divorce and all ancillary matters. Cases on this track can proceed more quickly, with less cost, and also less friction for the parties and their children. Many couples have benefitted from this.&nbsp;

{:start="41"}
41.  In 2022, two thirds of all divorce cases were decided on the Simplified Track. Let me explain why I decided on this.

{:start="42"}
42.  As a lawyer, in my practice, I might have done three or four divorce cases in my life as I was a commercial litigator. But what those cases brought home to me was that the parties usually use the divorce as a way of re-arguing their entire marital history. Lawyers charge by the (xx), so you get thick affidavits on all sides costing tens of thousands of dollars, and all for no purpose.

{:start="43"}
43.  I kept telling people that there are only three issues. One is whether the marriage has broken down. Obviously, it has by the time you are at the gates of the court. In some cases, rehab can work but usually it is already broken up.

{:start="44"}
44.  Two is how would the money be split and there are two aspects to it. One is the capital sum and the other is a monthly maintenance, which is more mathematical than emotional. Three and most importantly, is how you take care of the children.

{:start="45"}
45.  So instead of dealing with those three areas… The lady I was acting for puts down these things, saying that the man was looking at porn 13 years ago and how she found this and that. The man then said they are Catholics but the sister was pregnant while walking down the altar. I said, “What does that have to do with your marriage?” The man then said “But she has said all these things, she pour salt over my clients at the Christmas dinner and I am a bank CEO.” I then said “Let’s just talk about today.” “No we cannot.” So there is a lot of angst and emotions. Once you (xx) the entire marriage.

{:start="46"}
46.  When I was member of Parliament, in fact Minister, a lady came to see me. She was earning maybe about five to six thousand dollars working in NTUC. She had two kids and had already spent about S$40,000 with no orders yet and repeated postponements.

{:start="47"}
47.  First, is the money. S$40,000 is a lot of money, and it is on her salary. Two, each time there is a hearing, she has got to take leave and go to court. You have to take leave to deal with your children, as well as to deal with this recalcitrant husband and the court process.

{:start="48"}
48.  The pressure on women, especially when they are not so well-educated and not well-resourced, is tremendous. If we can get rid of a lot of the angst and make it more simplified.

{:start="49"}
49.  I had the vision that it should just be within one page, you do not need a two-hundred-page affidavit. Has the marriage broken down? How much do you say you ought to get and why, in terms of money and alimony? And what should happen to the children?

{:start="50"}
50.  I said lawyers should explain to the court, why do they want to go beyond one page. We will in fact prepare the form, you will charge for just one page and the court should encourage this simplified process.

{:start="51"}
51.  I am glad to know two thirds of divorce cases are going through this process and it is a lot less money spent. Most of the women who go through such situations do not share the same profiles as the women here at this conference, by and large, and we need to help them.

{:start="52"}
52.  The further change is to allow married couples to divorce by mutual agreement. There was some concern as ours is a conservative society in general. I am one of those who believe that maybe we ought to make marriage difficult so that people understand what they are getting into. However, if they really want to get out of it, we should not make it too difficult, especially if they really cannot get along, but that does not mean that you can just walk away. Of course, you will still need processes to try for reconciliation.
  
{:start="53"}
53.  This is intended to reduce acrimony for husbands and wives and allow them to take joint responsibility for the breakdown of marriage. It can also help to make divorce a less traumatic experience for the children.&nbsp;

{:start="54"}
54.  More recently, in May, MinLaw and MSF jointly passed the Family Justice Reform Act. One of the key issues which the Act seeks to address is the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders.&nbsp;

{:start="55"}
55.  What does it all mean? I am a very practical person. That is the bottom line of all of this, you simplify all of this into what women want. They want to go away, they want to be paid on time and they want to be able to look after their children.

{:start="56"}
56.  The difficulty is usually (xx) pay on time. If the husband does not have money, he does not have money. However, even with men that have money, they might find a variety of excuses. “I spend money on buying shampoo for my pet toad. The Mercedes Benz that I am driving is being held on trust for my father.” And that is not invented, somebody actually said that.

{:start="57"}
57.  So you get all this and what happens is that you would use the traditional court process and I was a litigator so I know what that is like. The woman will have to get a lawyer, and she will have to apply to court. The lawyer will then have to apply to a variety of institutions based on the court order. Sometimes the court order is clear, sometimes it is not. Then you serve the court order and the man has to file an affidavit. He says maybe 15 per cent of what he has to say. How do you know what assets he has? What bank accounts he has, which ones belong to him and which ones belong to his family. Suddenly everything is being held on trust for the family. Houses and assets get sold as well, so it is an impossible task to put on a single woman.&nbsp;

{:start="58"}
58.  If you put it on her, it just fractures the relationship or what is left of it. The parties will just start weaponising their children and the children will grow up in a very toxic atmosphere. It is not good for the man, for the woman and for the children.

{:start="59"}
59. If you look at the statistics between 2017 to 2019, there was an annual average of about 2,700 applications to enforce maintenance orders. One-third were repeat applications made within the same year. Three to four applications within the same year is not unusual.&nbsp;

{:start="60"}
60. Majority of the applicants were women applying for themselves or for their minor children. Single mothers struggling to juggle work, children and other responsibilities. Outstanding maintenance issues usually means that they have to engage their ex-husbands, seek legal advice and attend enforcement hearings in Court. You have to take leave and go for all these things. So your bills are adding up, you have no money, you are holding a job sometimes if you are lucky, your children need attention and you take leave to go to Court. Courts are usually kind to recalcitrant, whether they are women or men, because they do not want to send people to jail. So the man comes and says “Well, I did not have the money. I did not pay her. I know the Court said to pay but I did not as I did not have the money.” The Court will say “Okay, do not be a naughty boy and go back.” And then three months later, the guy still has not paid and then another application is raised, and it goes on and on.&nbsp;

{:start="61"}
61.  It is not the Court’s fault because they do not want to send people to jail unnecessarily. You do not know who is telling the truth. For every eight guys who are lying, there are two who might be telling the truth, and then you would be sending an innocent man to jail. The Court sitting there does not have the resources to know what assets the man has or does not have.

{:start="62"}
62. I shared some examples of real-life cases, in Parliament. One of them is Mdm A. This is how she described her frustrations in an email to me: 

{:start="63"}
63. *“Monies have to be spent each time an individual seeks legal advice; Monies that most ex-spouses can ill-afford. Perhaps this is why most give up the fight, because they can no longer afford to pay for another court hearing and receive another ruling that will not be enforced.”*
 
{:start="64"}
64.  So we introduced a very radical process, in fact we went round the world to see where else had anything that was comparable but we did not find any. So essentially, a new unit has been set up, called the Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs), established under MinLaw.

{:start="65"}
65.  MEOs are basically civil servants and will be empowered. After the maintenance order, upon application, instead of the lady having to apply to Court, the MEOs will now be empowered similar to the CPIB or the Police. They will be able to go and ask banks, CDP, and agencies including CPF Board, HDB, IRAS, SLA and LTA for information. If the man has a job, they can ask his employer where his salary is going. They can ask the man to set out an affidavit setting out his bank accounts, or the banks for the information. They can also ask IRAS for information, making it a bit more difficult for the man to run and without having to spend money on lawyers. I have got nothing against lawyers but I think it should be more productive than this.

{:start="66"}
66.  Therefore, a comprehensive financial and situational picture is put up by an officer from the Government, which means taxpayers’ money, but I think it is well spent in this case. With this obtained information, the MEO will file a report indicating that these are the assets and then we will be able to distinguish between those who cannot pay and those who refuse to pay.

{:start="67"}
67.  For those who cannot pay, I think we ought to treat them sympathetically, even if the woman and children are suffering. If he cannot pay then he cannot pay, what would you want to do? Send him to jail? You can go and ask him to work but beyond that, for those who refuse to pay, I think you can take tougher action. This facilitates a more sustainable maintenance outcome and for those who refuse to pay, I think it strengthens deterrence.

{:start="68"}
68.  Once you file the report, I think people can agree there can be conciliation by being sensible and indicating the amount that ought to be paid. However, if it cannot be settled, then the Court will make a Show-Payment Order (SPO). The SPO will require the respondent to come back to Court at specified intervals and show proof that he has complied with his maintenance obligations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
{:start="69"}
69.  The SPO will typically last for six months. If the respondent does not show proof of payment, he will be imprisoned unless he can show good reasons for non-payment. Sounds a bit harsh but I am sure the courts will approach this in a sensible way.

{:start="70"}
70.  Again, this is a framework. Once a framework is established, it also establishes norms for behaviour. Once you go to a lawyer, the lawyer will advise all these things that I have just said. I think that shifts thinking and behaviour, and hopefully we do not get many cases after that and everybody starts behaving.

**CONCLUSION**

{:start="71"}
71.  I have taken it almost a little bit like a law tutorial, but it is to explain that the law has changed very substantially to support women, and in odd cases men too, as to whoever is the victim. There are also some cases where the woman is financially in a much better position compared to the man, and (xx).

{:start="72"}
72. This I am hoping would continuously change in our norms and behaviour, so that divorce becomes more administrative and less emotional, and the children and the parties can go on to lead their lives afresh.

{:start="73"}
73.  That must be the purpose of divorce. For whatever reason that the marriage does not work, both parties should be able to go off, start their new lives and deal with the obligations in a sensible way.&nbsp;

{:start="74"}
74.  We are taking care of the violence and the maintenance in a way that removes a large amount of the burden. I should touch also on something that we had worked with MSF. In fact, MOS Sun and (xx) were heading this committee of (xx) in a marriage situation.

{:start="75"}
75.  Say there is a threat of violence or anger. The woman feels threatened, the children are fearful, but nothing has happened, so what do you do?

{:start="76"}
76.  We have moved to put a framework where if a woman calls, the Police together with MSF officers will turn up at the residence. They will then assess the situation and if the woman is fearful, even if there had been no assault, we will find alternate accommodation for her, whether for one night or a few. This is to remove the threatened victim from that situation of danger, threat or fear, where they can assess their situation more calmly and with a little bit less fear. If they stay outside you never know what is going to happen in the middle of the night, so they will be given alternate accommodation and then counsellors and NGOs can talk to them to see what can be done to help them. Hopefully they reconcile, hopefully there is anger management and hopefully the man comes to his senses. However, if it is something that we see as a key pattern, then we will try and persuade the parties to find (xx). Ultimately it is a managing act and that is a major intervention.

{:start="77"}
77.  What exactly are we doing? We are putting the State as a sort of support underpinning. To in fact, support the marriage because our hope is that after the removal, of giving accommodation to the victim, they will be able to go back and reconcile. However, if they cannot, that is their choice as well.

{:start="78"}
78.  In conclusion, we have continually reviewed and adapted our laws to help create a fairer and more equitable society. Because women are primarily the “weaker” partners, they are the ones who will benefit more from this framework of laws, but having good laws is just one facet. It has to be matched by a willingness on the ground, in our own daily lives, to really make a difference to the lived experiences of women.
  
{:start="79"}
79.  In that context, I am very pleased to see many groups here today which are dedicated to making this kind of positive change including AWARE, Casa Raudha, PAVE, SCWO, Society Against Family Violence and, of course, the organisers – SHE.&nbsp;
 
{:start="80"}
80.  I look forward to seeing these organisations do more good work.&nbsp;

{:start="81"}
81.  Thank you very much.**
