Ladies and Gentlemen


1. I am so honoured to join you all over here, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions. Although we say that the Conventions were concluded in 1949; the earliest seeds of the Conventions were actually planted much earlier.

 

2. I would like to thank the Singapore Red Cross and the National Library Board for putting this seminar together. I think it is important to have occasions like these, where you bring like-minded people together to share ideas, discuss, debate, and more importantly, chart the way forward. 70 years marks a great achievement, but we need to continue the discussion on how to make the Conventions relevant, not just today, but also in the future.

 

3. The importance of the Geneva Conventions cannot be understated. This is despite the fact that 70 years have passed from the time when the Conventions were concluded. However, it is no less important today. Whether we know it or not, we have been enjoying the protection of the Geneva Conventions.

 

4. We try to avoid conflict and wars as far as possible. We resort to peaceable means, mediated agreements, and other ways – especially in order to avoid armed conflict. However, when such conflict is unavoidable, the obligations within the Geneva Conventions then become applicable and important. The obligations are also universal. They regulate how war is to be waged, if war cannot be avoided. They also apply where there is armed conflict falling short of war, regardless of whether such armed conflict is international in nature. Thus, the Geneva Conventions do play an important and necessary role in minimising human suffering and in protecting civilians and non-combatants.

 

5. The Geneva Conventions have seen a long history dating back to 1864, if not, earlier. That was when the first Geneva Conventions for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field was adopted. The version that we are most familiar with today was created in 1949, shortly after the end of World War II. That was when the scope of the Geneva Conventions was significantly expanded to accord more protection to civilians and non-combatants.

 

6. Today, 70 years down the road, it is easy for many of us in Singapore - where we enjoy a safe and peaceful environment - to be desensitized to news of armed conflict and refugee crises happening elsewhere in the world. This is not something that we can brush aside simply because we are living in relatively peaceful times in Singapore. We must not forget that we enjoy this peace mainly because of instruments like the Geneva Conventions.

 

7. On 27 April 1973, Singapore acceded to the Geneva Conventions, and we then quickly enacted the Geneva Conventions Act, within that same year, to give effect to the Geneva Conventions.

 

8. In Singapore, not only do we intend to comply fully with the Geneva Conventions, we also intend to do our part in disseminating knowledge of its provisions and to raise awareness through occasions like today's seminar.

 

9. Singapore is a small country. As such, it is paramount for us to be a responsible citizen, and to abide by the rules of law. We do so by subscribing to internationally accepted norms in our own international dealings: whether it is political, social, economic, military – what underpins all of this is a strong rule of law.

 

10. The Geneva Conventions have been universally ratified, and they continue today to form the bedrock of international humanitarian law. It is of course an important aspect of international law, which is increasingly visible, and increasingly applicable. It is also an important aspect of the rule of law among nations.

 

11. As we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Conventions, and acknowledge how far international humanitarian law has come, it is important that we duly recognize the evolving context of international humanitarian law. It is important for us to keep the laws relevant, so that emerging trends in international humanitarian law may be addressed.

 

12. The demands on international humanitarian laws are rapidly changing. Many of the demands are driven by advances in technology. International humanitarian law is no different from other aspects of life in that it is also susceptible to disruptions by technology and artificial intelligence. Some examples of such advancements in technology include the use of cyber warfare and autonomous weapons. In particular, we are witnessing an emergence of the use of technologically advanced and unmanned military systems in the battlefield.

 

13. The advent of autonomous weapons is itself a significant development, because of the capacity of such weapons to quickly process information, and to make decisions with little to no direct human oversight and control. They have therefore begun to challenge our current understanding of the legality of weapon usage and methods of warfare. More fundamentally, our conceptions of accountability and legal responsibility in the context of warfare are also challenged.

 

14. Whilst the precision of such autonomous weapons could potentially reduce unintended casualties and collateral damage to civilian infrastructure, many new legal issues and questions have arisen.

 

15. Our main challenge moving forward in light of this evolving context is to ensure that the rules of international humanitarian law continue to be developed in a principled manner, so as to remain relevant by properly accounting for new scenarios and methods of warfare.

 

16. We must also continue to be vigilant and recall that the fundamental rules of international humanitarian laws are not mere suggestions. They are not mere ideals or aspirations that we try, if we can, to live up to. They are in fact internationally binding rules, which serve to limit the human cost of war.

 

17. Events such as today’s seminar will help to congregate like-minded individuals like yourselves to ensure that we have a continuing dialogue on these important issues.

 

18. I would be very remiss if I did not also highlight the contributions of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and of course, the Singapore Red Cross.

 

19. The 1949 Conventions were formulated at the close of a World War, on the initiative of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and of course, with the support of the Swiss government.

 

20. To this day, the International Committee of the Red Cross remains a key custodian of international humanitarian law, and continues to do good work to actively promote the development and implementation of international humanitarian laws in all nations.

 

21. This year also marks the 70th anniversary of, not only the Geneva Conventions, but also the Singapore Red Cross. It is an impartial, neutral, and independent organization, whose exclusive humanitarian mission is to protect the lives and dignity of victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence and hardship, and to provide them with assistance. The Singapore Red Cross actively works with the Singapore Government in the promotion of international humanitarian laws, and the exercise of obligations under the Geneva Conventions.

 

22. In particular, I am aware that the Singapore Red Cross Academy supports and organises various programmes to generate interest in international humanitarian laws amongst our youth. The Humanitarian Lecture Series; moots for law students; and Inter-School debates at the Secondary and Polytechnic levels – all lend a fun but informative way in which our next generation of leaders can gain more knowledge or insights in this field. These are just some of the examples of the good work done by the Singapore Red Cross to ensure that new generations learn about the importance of the Geneva Conventions.

 

23. I congratulate the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Singapore Red Cross for all the good work done over the years. Selfless leadership, thoughtful dedication, and compassion – these are hallmarks of the work that you have done. I wish you all the very best in the future, and I hope that all of you will continue to debate on the important issues and continue to raise awareness about the Geneva Conventions. I hope that you will have an enriching seminar ahead. Thank you very much and have a pleasant day.
