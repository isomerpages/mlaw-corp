Your excellencies, 
Ladies and gentlemen,
Distinguished guests,

{:start="1"}
1.	Thank you for inviting me here.

{:start="2"}
2.	In the past two days, you have heard about the impact of this war in Europe, its effect on the global rules-based order, the economic impacts, what it means for ASEAN and other regional structures in Southeast Asia, and in the realm of defence, what it means including against hybrid threats.

** I. INTRODUCTION **

{:start="3"}
3.	In my speech, I want to take a step back to look at the broader history on what happened and try to draw some learning points.

{:start="4"}
4.	I do this because we are subjected to a lot of viewpoints every day, and to make sense, we have to understand the underlying facts.

{:start="5"}
5.	Before I do that, let me set out a framework and get some points clear.

{:start="6"}
6.	One, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a clear and gross violation of international law and the principles enshrined in the UN Charter.

{:start="7"}
7.	We, Singapore, has taken a firm stand. We co-sponsored and voted in favour of several resolutions at the United Nations (UN) condemning Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. We imposed sanctions against Russia, and blocked some Russian banks and financial transactions connected to Russia.

{:start="8"}
8.	In fact, we were the only Southeast Asian country to sanction Russia, and one of just a small handful of Asian countries to have done so.

{:start="9"}
9.	Nine years ago, when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, I was the Foreign Minister, and I stated our position in Parliament. I said that we strongly object to any unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country under any pretext or excuse. Russian troops should not be in Ukraine in breach of international law. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine must be respected. International law must be respected. It was nine years, almost to the day.

{:start="10"}
10.	This is not about being pro- or anti- Russia or pro- or anti- any other country.

{:start="11"}
11.	For example, in 1978, when Vietnam invaded Cambodia – back then, it was called Kampuchea – and in 1983, when the US invaded Grenada, we also opposed the invasions and voted in favour of UN resolutions that called for the invasions to end.

{:start="12"}
12.	Sovereignty is an existential principle to small countries like Singapore.  

{:start="13"}
13.	There can be real-world consequences if one country can unilaterally invade another country, whether on the excuse of common history, alleged historical errors or any other excuse.

{:start="14"}
14.	If these principles are accepted, there is nothing to say that another country cannot use the same reasoning with Singapore.

{:start="15"}
15.	For example, in a different context, we have seen Dr Mahathir say in June last year, 4 months after the Ukraine invasion, that Singapore and the Riau Islands are historically “Tanah Melayu” or Malay Lands, which Malaysia could demand to take back. On 19 June, he said that. This is not a game. It is serious business. If you get a leader in Malaysia like Dr Mahathir, adventurous ideas may be attempted.

{:start="16"}
16.	Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is also a major humanitarian crisis. The human impact is immense. Millions are being displaced. Thousands are dying. And really, it is beyond sad.

{:start="17"}
17.	These points are, in my view, un-arguable. The war has to end. That much is clear.

{:start="18"}
18.	Now, let me, as I said earlier, step back and go to the broader questions.

{:start="19"}
19.	When looking at the facts, one key question is – What responsibility do others, beyond Russia, have?  

**II. TWO DIFFERENT VIEWS**

{:start="20"}
20.	On this question, let me give you two alternate views.

<u> A. Western View</u>

{:start="21"}
 21.	The Western view, primarily from the Western media, Western bloc, and Western leaders, is that President Putin has imperial ambitions. Russia invaded Ukraine because of his megalomania.

{:start="22"}
 22.	And, he is nostalgic about the Soviet Union. When the USSR broke up in 1991, Moscow lost control of its Soviet Empire. The President has called that the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century (he said that in 2005) and the demise of “historical Russia” (he said that in 2021).

{:start="23"}
23.	And it is said that President Putin wants to restore Russia’s former status to recreate the Soviet Union, to bring back some, or all, of the former-Soviet states under the authority of Russia.

{:start="24"}
24.	Ukraine, in particular was a particularly painful loss, because the President believes that since Russia and Ukraine share a long and common history. In spite of the fact that both had evolved into different countries, Ukraine has to be in Russia’s sphere of influence.

{:start="25"}
25.	The President’s speech shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, is often referred to, that: 
  
    a.	Modern Ukraine was just a creation by Communist Russia; 
    
    b.	Ukraine never actually had stable traditions of real statehood; and

    c.	Its separation from Russia was a historic and strategic mistake.

{:start="26"}
26.	In other words, Ukraine’s sovereignty is an artificial construct, and that sovereignty does not have to be respected.

{:start="27"}
27.	I think for any neutral, this last statement is particularly problematic, given that Russia had specifically committed to respect the statehood and integrity of Ukraine in 1994.

{:start="28"}
28.	That was the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, where Ukraine had agreed to give up its nuclear arsenal. Some will know that Ukraine had the 3rd largest nuclear arsenal at that point.

{:start="29"}
29.	In exchange, Russia, along with the US and UK, committed to respect the independence, sovereignty, and the 1994 borders of Ukraine as a security guarantee.

{:start="30"}
30.	A guarantee that Russia disregarded – first, when it invaded Crimea 20 years after the Memorandum, in 2014; and again, when Russia invaded Ukraine outright last year.

{:start="31"}
31.	It is also asserted from the Western point of view that prior to the war, Ukraine joining NATO was “not on NATO’s agenda”. And that Russia was using trumped up excuses about NATO expansion as a cover to take Ukraine and revive Russia to its former glory.

{:start="32"}
32.	The New York Times, in an article last week, put it this way, that the President is “intent on securing a place in the pantheon of historic, expansionist Russian leaders” by styling himself as a “modern-day Peter the Great, gathering up lost Russian lands.”

{:start="33"}
33.	So, that is one view – Essentially, that it is Russia and President Putin who are the sole irresponsible actors, and the President’s own ambitions have led to all these sufferings.

{:start="34"}
34.	A fair bit of this is accurate, in my view. But it doesn’t convey the whole picture.

{:start="35"}
35.	It too conveniently absolves the West of any responsibility for the way the events have unfolded.

{:start="36"}
36.	Even as I say this, let me emphasise that nothing in the background can excuse the violation of Ukraine or the war.

{:start="37"}
37.	But with that, let us look at the alternate view.

<u> B. Another View</u>

{:start="38"}
38.	Some like Anatol Lieven have pointed out that President Putin was not always opposed to cooperation with the West. Russia had made overtures for cooperation and peaceful co-existence.

{:start="39"}
39.	The President wrote, in 2012, that Russia is an inalienable, organic part of the wider European Civilisation. And that he hoped for a harmonious community of economies “from Lisbon to Vladivostok”.

{:start="40"}
40.	Former Russian President Medvedev, with Mr Putin’s approval (Mr Putin was the Prime Minister then), tried to propose a European security treaty in 2010 which would have institutionalised consultation between Russia and Western countries on equal terms.

{:start="41"}
41.	Was Russia just bluffing when it said it was keen on integrating with Europe and the West?

{:start="42"}
42.	There are credible scholars who believe that Russia was serious.
{:start="43"}
43.	The truth also, is that in the 1990s and 2000s, Russia was treated as a has-been. It was not seriously consulted in major issues. And it was not treated with a great deal of respect.

{:start="44"}
44.	The Neo Cons in the US saw the US as the hyper power in a unipolar world.

{:start="45"}
45.	Russia had nukes, but it was seen as weak. America could do pretty much what it wanted – invade or interfere in countries when it felt threatened or to serve its own interests, and the others just had to accept.

{:start="46"}
46.	Thus, Russia’s security concerns were not taken seriously, and the US in this view, did not respect Russia’s legitimate security concerns.

{:start="47"}
47.	The West proceeded with the NATO expansion after the Cold War, and Russia was feeling increasingly encircled.

{:start="48"}
48.	When you look at these competing viewpoints, then you have to go back to the facts and cross-check.

<u>III. FACTS / CHRONOLOGY</u>

{:start="49"}
49.	What are the facts?

{:start="50"}
50.	One question that comes up repeatedly – Did the US promise not to expand NATO eastwards? The “not one inch” point.

<u>A. Genesis of “Not One Inch”</u>

{:start="51"}
51.	In 1990, as the Cold War was ending and the Berlin Wall fell, the US and USSR were discussing how to reunify Germany.

{:start="52"}
52.	One question that was raised was whether NATO would then expand into the territory of East Germany, and perhaps beyond, at the expense of the then- Warsaw Pact countries.

{:start="53"}
53.	Western leaders anticipated Soviet opposition to NATO’s expansion.  

{:start="54"}
54.	And records show that Western leaders had broached, in various formulations, the concept of Non-Expansion of NATO.

{:start="55"}
55.	This would be a quid pro quo. In exchange, Moscow would agree to East Germany’s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Germany.

{:start="56"}
56.	In a speech on 31 January 1990, West Germany’s then-Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, acknowledged the USSR’s security interests and said that in the process of reunification, NATO should rule out eastward expansion.

{:start="57"}
57.	Less than two weeks later, then-US Secretary of State, James Baker, also raised this with the Soviet Foreign Minister, and President Gorbachev.

{:start="58"}
58.	According to declassified records from the US State Department, and from Germany, and from the Gorbachev Foundation, Baker proposed several times, that NATO would not expand “one inch to the east”.

{:start="59"}
59.	Though, it appears that the Bush administration in Washington DC may have had different views about this.

{:start="60"}
60.	In separate discussions between Mr Gorbachev, German Chancellor Helmut Kohland, and French President Francois Mitterran, both acknowledged that NATO expansion would be a problem for the USSR, which would need to be addressed.
