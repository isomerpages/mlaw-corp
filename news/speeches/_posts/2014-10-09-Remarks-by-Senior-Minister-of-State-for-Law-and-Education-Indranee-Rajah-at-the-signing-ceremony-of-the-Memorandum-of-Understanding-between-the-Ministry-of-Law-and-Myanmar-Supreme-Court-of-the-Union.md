Ladies and Gentlemen  


**INTRODUCTION**


1. *Mingalabar!* At the outset, please allow me to thank you for the warm welcome that you have extended to myself and the Singaporean delegation and also for hosting today’s event. The members of the team have not only been impressed by the beauty of your country, but also by your graciousness and hospitality.  


2. Today marks a momentous occasion between Singapore and Myanmar. This afternoon, Singapore’s Ministry of Law and Myanmar’s Supreme Court of the Union have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Singapore-Myanmar Integrated Legal Exchange. This Integrated Legal Exchange marks a new chapter in legal cooperation between our countries.


3. Myanmar and Singapore have always shared a close and warm relationship. Bilateral ties between our countries have strengthened since the establishment of diplomatic relations as far back as 1966.  We have developed strong economic ties.  In 2013, Singapore was Myanmar’s third largest trading partner and bilateral trade increased by 71 per cent to reach S$3.0 billion. In the first five months of 2014, Singapore topped the Foreign Direct Investment list in Myanmar.


4. Legal cooperation between the two countries has also been growing. As we share a common tradition and heritage, it is natural for us to build our ties in this area. Over the years, we have learnt more about each other’s legal frameworks and laws.  Our officials have developed close friendships through their interactions at various bilateral and international platforms.  Earlier in February this year, the law faculties of the National University of Singapore and the Singapore Management University signed MOUs with their counterparts at the University of Yangon and the University of Mandalay respectively to enhance cooperation in legal education.


5. The signing of the MOU between Myanmar’s Supreme Court of the Union and Singapore’s Ministry of Law will mark a new chapter in the partnership between our two countries towards a shared commitment to enhance the Rule of Law.  The judiciary plays a key role in upholding the Rule of Law in any country.  The judiciary helps enforce legal rules and requirements, which in turn creates an enabling environment for a country’s development, and promotes the welfare of its people.  We hope that the legal cooperation partnership between Singapore and Myanmar will help our officers to better serve the community and strengthen the Rule of Law in both our countries.


6. Under the MOU, our agencies will collaborate to organise a series of law workshops and seminars on various subject areas of interest to both sides.  Judicial officers will also have the opportunity to participate in customised attachments.  They will have the platform to learn from one another and benefit from their shared experiences.  Finally, the Singapore Ministry of Law will establish a scholarship for outstanding Myanmar officials who wish to pursue a Masters of Law at either the National University of Singapore or the Singapore Management University.  I am confident that the MOU will help to bring our legal fraternities closer together in a mutual process of learning and discovery.

7. On this note, it gives me great pleasure to announce that the Singapore Ministry of Law will be contributing a set of Halsbury’s Laws to the Supreme Court of the Union.

8. The Halsbury’s Laws will cover a broad range of subjects. This series adds to the Singapore Law Collection that we contributed earlier this year.  We hope that it will be a useful resource, adding to the Supreme Court’s legal research capabilities.
