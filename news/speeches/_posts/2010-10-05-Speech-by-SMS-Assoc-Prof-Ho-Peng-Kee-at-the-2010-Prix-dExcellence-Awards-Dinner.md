Dr Lim Lan Yuan, President of FIABCI Singapore,  
Ms Gillian Tay, Chairperson of the Organising Committee,  
Distinguished Guests,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  


1. Good evening.  I am happy to join you this evening to celebrate Singapore’s winning of three Prix d’Excellence awards.  This is a significant achievement for Singapore, and for our real estate, construction and architectural fraternities. The Prix d’Excellence award is much sought after by developers, builders and architects around the world, as it is only conferred on developments that have demonstrated excellence in all of the real estate disciplines. 

2. My warmest congratulations to Far East Organization, City Development Ltd, UOL Group Ltd, DP Architects, Team Design Architects and P & T Consultants Pte Ltd for winning top awards in the Office, Residential and Hotel categories. Indeed, it is noteworthy that Far East Organization is the only developer in the world with the highest number of wins. These achievements are testaments of the high standards achieved by Singapore’s developers and architects, reflecting the growing international recognition of our creativity, talent and quality.

**The Role of Developers and Architects**

3. Our vision for Singapore is a distinctive cosmopolitan city that is both a shining example of a global city of tomorrow and an endearing home for all.  As developers and architects, you play a critical role in shaping our constantly evolving cityscape. Your works form the elements of the urban backdrop to our daily life and help forge a distinctive Singapore skyline that Singaporeans can be proud of, and that visitors to our shores find memorable!   

{:start="4"}
4. Whilst achieving this, you also need to create and enhance the working, living and public spaces within which Singaporeans and other residents living here interact with one another. The challenge therefore is that Singapore must not only be a city known for its dramatic and exciting cityscape, but is also an inclusive, liveable and vibrant city that is enjoyed and embraced by citizens and visitors alike.

**Architecture and Urban Design Excellence**

5. A quality urban environment helps elevate our quality of life and physical environment, bringing about tangible economic and financial dividends in attracting talents and businesses, more tourist arrivals, fostering creativity, and engendering a sense of rootedness among its citizens. Hence, a maturing and growing Singapore requires, without a doubt, excellence in architecture and urban design as it is increasingly a factor that enhances the experience of a city.  Attaining such excellence requires attention to be paid not just to high standards in design aesthetics and functionality, but also to the increasingly important elements of environmental sustainability, social inclusiveness and our heritage.

6. I am heartened by the progress Singapore has made in this area. I encourage you to continue to apply innovation and creative thinking to your design and building processes. Not only will this push the frontiers of design, it will also raise Singapore’s status as a global city abuzz with new ideas and energy. 

{:start="7"}
7. On its part, the Government will play its part to incorporate the concepts of architectural excellence and good urban design in its work. Be it in our housing estates or large scale development projects such as Marina Bay, down to streets and open spaces, the Government is committed to a built environment that facilitates Singapore’s economic growth, whilst also meeting the needs of its people and the environment. The evidence of this commitment is there for all to see. In this regard, I look forward to your continual partnership with the Government to come up with new designs that will enhance our built environment.

{:start="8"}
8. In addition, the Government aims to create an environment that promotes the recognition and appreciation of good urban design.  To this end, the Urban Redevelopment Authority, or URA, has been working with the private sector to showcase local projects with excellent urban design through its Architecture and Urban Design Excellence programme, and the annual President’s Design Award. For instance, the URA is currently holding a ‘20 Under 45’ exhibition at the URA Centre to showcase the works of 20 locally-registered architects under the age of 45.  Through the exhibition, the URA hopes to raise the profile of locally-registered architectural talents and provide wider public and industry exposure for them

**Prix d’Excellence Awards**

9. In short, the entire fraternity must rally around and be involved as we press on resolutely towards our vision of a Singapore that is a world class city of the future. Thank you for your unwavering enthusiasm. The fact that Singapore has won so many Prix d’Excellence awards since 1997 shows that we do have rich talent and creativity here. My interaction with the young bears this out clearly.

{:start="10"}
10. Once again, my heartiest congratulations to all winners for being conferred these prestigious awards on a globally-recognised platform.  You make us proud and bring honour to Singapore. Your success stories showcasing the virtues of architecture and urban design excellence in Singapore will, I am sure, inspire more of such stories, especially amongst our developers and architects. It leaves me now to wish you every success in all your future undertakings as you continue to contribute to Singapore’s physical landscape.

{:start="11"}
11. Have a pleasant evening.
