Ladies and Gentlemen

**I. Introduction**

{:start="1"}
1.  Good evening, everyone. Thank you very much for being here. Just your presence alone underscores the importance of the work that SHE has done and will continue to do.

{:start="2"}
2. SHE has grown tremendously in this short period of time. It is really not possible without Stefanie, who has been a sheer force, and a real unstoppable force. I thank the Board very much for supporting all the efforts and always being there at the front line, the wonderful team at SHE, and the growing pool of volunteers that SHE has. But more important this evening is to thank each and every one of you for being here, for supporting SHE, for entrusting confidence in the work that SHE has done.

{:start="3"}	
3. We have seen what Stefanie has presented. It is really a testament to all the efforts that have been put in, supported and empowered by the donations, the support and the resources that are put forward.

{:start="4"}	
4. This evening, we are here really because we believe in a fairer and more inclusive society, where all Singaporeans, including, maybe some might say, particularly women and children, can flourish and achieve their aspirations.

{:start="5"}	
5. In a very short time since its founding, SHE has been very accomplished –

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) from establishing SHECARES@SCWO (“SHECARES”), Singapore’s first one-stop support centre for survivors of online harms.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(2) They have also launched career programmes for girls and women, and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(3) become a strong advocate for women’s issues both locally as well as on the global stage.</p>

{:start="6"}	
6. In the past two years alone, SHECARES supported close to 260 survivors of online harms, of whom 9 in 10 are women.

{:start="7"}	
7. We know that online harms, such as online harassment. intimate image abuse, can be extremely distressing and particularly disempowering.

{:start="8"}	
8. Survivors often feel helpless and overwhelmed, which is where SHECARES steps in with its free counselling services, pro bono legal assistance, as well as help with platform reporting.

{:start="9"}	
9. It is always heartening to hear about how clients of SHECARES have coped with the ordeal, and come back stronger. And when they come back, they speak about the help that they got. In some ways, it surprised me when I went through some of these narratives to find out that it is not just about the legal help, the pro bono services, but it is really just about being there, being there as a pillar of support, a listening ear, a kind word.

{:start="10"}	
10. As someone has said, “Thank you very much for listening to me, for validating how I feel and understanding what I have gone through, and just being there to not judge me for what I have gone through, but to be there.

{:start="11"}	
11. I think that is really tremendous. This kind of support is not something that you can plan for, but it really has to come from the heart. So I thank all the many volunteers who have made this happened.

{:start="12"}	
12. SHE has also been busy on the career front, inspiring young minds through the Sneak Peek programme, bringing female youths behind the scenes at corporates from the public, private and people sectors to expose them to diverse career paths.

{:start="13"}	
13. One of the things that I feel very fortunate as I look back on my career was the presence of many mentors as I went from one career stage to another. I think that is what many young people, especially young girls, lack –  to have a good mentor who has been there, done that, who have trodden the path and can turn back and say, “Here, take my hand, let me lead you along, because I know the path forward and I can guide you.” I think that is a very good spirit.

{:start="14"}	
14. In 2024 last year, more than 200 girls from 19 schools, some of whom are right here in the audience tonight, participated in these learning visits.

{:start="15"}	
15. I heard that one student, in particular, left with a renewed understanding of what it takes to have a career in the banking industry, after her visit to the Standard Chartered Bank. She learnt, to her surprise, that an accounting degree is not mandatory, not necessary, and there were in fact different career paths within the bank. She was keen and very bent on joining the bank, and she thought that not having an accounting degree would foreclose that option for her.

{:start="16"}	
16. Since the launch in March 2024, 150 women have attended, with 16 partner organisations pledging to be involved.

{:start="17"}	
17. But beyond these initiatives on the ground, SHE has also been a vocal advocate about women’s issues, facilitating dialogue and research on important topics, such as its research studies on gender mindsets and online harms, in the past few years. They have been helpful in driving evidence-based reforms and policy development on our part.

{:start="18"}	
18. I want to take a moment to express my deep appreciation to SHE, everyone behind SHE, from the Board to its staff, to the many volunteers, for your contributions to our vision of a special Singaporean society – one that is inclusive, that brings everyone along, one that does not judge us by how well we have done at the top, but how much we have brought the person at the bottom along with us. I want to say a big thank you. Join me in thanking SHE for all the work that has been donen.

**II. Building a Fairer and More Inclusive Society**

{:start="19"}	
19. I want to say that building a fairer and more inclusive society is constantly work in progress. We have come a long way, but I think there is a lot more to be done. It is something that we have been working on for many years to achieve.

{:start="20"}	
20. I think it is important to build that level playing field for all Singaporeans, women and men, young and old, able-bodied and differently abled, so that no one is left behind.

{:start="21"}	
21. Everyone ought to have an equal opportunity to chase their aspirations, and realise their potential, regardless of where you may start in life, age, economic status or ability.

{:start="22"}	
22. We have thus been steadily building inclusion into our everyday lives, and reshaping norms and try to shift mindsets. Let me cite a few examples.

{:start="23"}	
23. <u>First</u>, we have managed the issue of gender inequality relatively well. Over the years, we have done, as a country, reasonably well.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), which all of us will be familiar with. The decade beginning 1993 saw 86 new cases. The next decade, from 2003 to 2012, saw 305 cases. And in the last decade, that has doubled to 603.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), which all of us will be familiar with. The decade beginning 1993 saw 86 new cases. The next decade, from 2003 to 2012, saw 305 cases. And in the last decade, that has doubled to 603.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), which all of us will be familiar with. The decade beginning 1993 saw 86 new cases. The next decade, from 2003 to 2012, saw 305 cases. And in the last decade, that has doubled to 603.</p>

{:start="24"}	
24. Hence, the increased global trade in the last few decades has corresponded to a rise in the internationalisation of commercial disputes. This is evidenced by the upward trend in the volume of cross-border investment and commercial disputes handled by international institutions right around the world. I think we will need our dispute resolution institutions to serve more and more of the international community.

{:start="25"}	
25. Let me give you some examples:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), which all of us will be familiar with. The decade beginning 1993 saw 86 new cases. The next decade, from 2003 to 2012, saw 305 cases. And in the last decade, that has doubled to 603.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(2) The number of claims filed in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has also grown – 39 cases in 2006, 111 cases in 2012, and last year in 2024, a 10-fold increase to 1,056 cases. I think this underscores two points. First, the increasing importance and relevance of the Middle Eastern economy and as a jurisdiction, and second, reflecting the way in which business is done and disputes are resolved internationally.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(3) The English Commercial Court has also seen an increase in its caseload over time, with about 75% of its cases involving one or more parties outside the UK.</p>

{:start="26"}	
26. It was in this context that, 10 years ago, we decided to set up the Singapore International Commercial Court (SICC). We recognised the increasing prominence of international disputes in Singapore. Earlier on, you heard Dinesh talk about Singapore – in the context of Southeast Asia and Asia – as a hub, as a node, in, from and through which parties are encouraged to do business.

{:start="27"}	
27. We grew the SICC over the years to meet the increasing demands of the international community. Since then, we have seen an increase in the internationalisation of the dispute resolution cases that come through Singapore. I know tomorrow’s programme will bring you to the SICC, so I thought I’ll say a few things about the SICC.

{:start="28"}	
28. When the SICC started in 2015, it had two transferred cases in its inaugural year, i.e. cases transferred from the Supreme Court of Singapore to the SICC. In 2024, the total number of cases heard by the SICC stood at 28, with 18 of them being fresh filings. Cases before the SICC involved parties coming from 62 different nationalities, reflecting, and as I said, underscoring the “international-ness” of the forum.

{:start="29"}	
29. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), has also seen a similar trend – a rise in caseload from around 200 cases a decade ago, to more than 600 cases today. Last year, SIAC received 625 cases from 72 different jurisdictions, of which 91% of those cases were international in nature.

{:start="30"}	
30. It is, I believe, important for dispute resolution institutions to be able to handle cross border disputes, and to be increasingly open to the fact that users of their system might not come from within its own domicile and its own jurisdiction. In this way, we designed the SICC quite deliberately to be able to handle cases that have a different genre and come from a different origin than what we are used to in Singapore.

{:start="31"}	
31. Earlier, we heard speeches of the development of the common law by great jurists like Lord Denning, but we have decided that in Singapore, where more than half of our trading partners that we do business with come from civil law jurisdictions, we do need to embrace civil law concepts, understand civil law practices, and also, in many ways, understand not just the legal background, but the cultural context and nuances that exist in these countries.

{:start="32"}	
32. So we have deliberately designed the SICC to have an international panel comprising eminent jurists from both common law, as well as civil law jurisdictions.

{:start="33"}	
33. We allow foreign lawyers and legal experts a right of audience directly before the Court, for example, in large international restructuring cases, many of which are deeply cross-border in nature. Having been in practice in this space, we may see some arbitrage being taken advantage of between different jurisdictions. You might have a case that is in Singapore on a restructuring, but you might have corresponding proceedings elsewhere, and we want to reduce that arbitrage as much as possible. So we allow for foreign lawyers and experts to have right of audience at the SICC.

{:start="34"}	
34. We have also allowed procedural flexibility in how parties may conduct their cases.

{:start="35"}	
35. We now have 24 International Judges who serve alongside our local judges on the SICC Bench. Our International Judges complement our Singapore Judges by being able to hear disputes governed by foreign law, with their deep experience, having specialist knowledge in specialised areas of commercial law, allowing us to enhance the reputation of the SICC, levelling up its thought leadership, and by and large, attracting foreign parties to litigate or to have their cases heard here in Singapore.

**IV. What Lies Ahead - Singapore's Approach**

{:start="36"}	
36. With this, it brings me to conclude with some observations of what Singapore’s approach has been over the years, and what we see in light of today’s geopolitical situation, economic climate, as well as the trading relations and the disruption to the rules-based order. I thought I would share, having moved from practice into policy-making over the last few years, Singapore’s perspective on how we see the legal industry in Singapore.

{:start="37"}	
37. <u>First</u>, as we look at an increasingly insular and protectionist world, protecting themselves with tariffs and barriers, we think that we need to go the opposite direction. We need to be completely open, or as open as possible. We need to maintain an open approach, not just in our economy, but particularly relevant to all of you, in our legal industry.

{:start="38"}	
38. We do this in a number of ways. We recognise that parties, litigants, their counsel want a choice.

{:start="39"}	
39. As I mentioned earlier, we have a broad, diverse panel on the SICC, and foreign counsel can appear before the SICC on matters of foreign law.

{:start="40"}	
40. We also have a broad range of different arbitrators and mediators on SIAC and SIMC. We resolve to bring in the best arbitrators onto the panel on SIAC, and are agnostic to their nationality. As long as they can bring value, have stature, be selected by parties, and give good awards, efficient, timely, we invite them onto the SIAC panel.

{:start="41"}	
41. We have also allowed, over the years, foreign lawyers and foreign law firms to be set up in Singapore to actively practise foreign law, and they can now directly participate in arbitration proceedings, even those involving Singapore law. The number of foreign lawyers practising in Singapore has grown over the decades. We started various schemes, more formally in 2000 so it has been 25 years, and we have seen the number of foreign lawyers grow in Singapore – four-fold since 2000.

{:start="42"}	
42. Our <u>second</u> approach is to continue to maintain a very fleet-footed approach, to be nimble, to be able to move fast in response to international changes, and more importantly, mercantile and commercial changes. That also comes in the form of how we look at setting up legal institutions, dispute resolution institutions, as well as the changes involved.

{:start="43"}	
43. The first example is the SICC. I mentioned that we set it up in 2015, but it was barely two years prior when it was first mooted by our Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon at the Opening of the Legal Year in 2013. We saw a gap, and we understood that it needed to be done quickly. And within two years, the legislation, the framework, the structure, and the personalities were in place to set up the SICC.

{:start="44"}	
44. Another example is in the passing of legislation. One of the advantages we have in Singapore is it is a small community and, I guess comparatively, a small Parliament, and one which allows us to move and respond very quickly. In the immediate aftermath of COVID-19, we realised that we had to protect lives and livelihoods. So we passed, on an emergency basis, COVID-19 legislation to effect changes, to change the ways in which contracts can be varied, to change the ways in which landlords and tenants could vary their arrangements, because there were many, particularly food and beverage offerings, that were unable to open by reason of legal imposition. So we passed the first legislation in Parliament in just 9 days.

{:start="45"}	
45. More importantly, in response to the tariff announcements on Liberation Day, we set up quickly a multi-agency taskforce, to study the impact of tariffs on our commercial entities, both large and small ones, and to help businesses respond and adapt, in the wake of these tariffs.

{:start="46"}	
46. <u>Third</u>, I think we need to continue to take a collaborative approach, looking at valued partners like the IBA, like many other thought leader institutions that are based in Singapore. Those of you who are familiar with the Maxwell Chambers will know that besides being a venue for dispute resolution, whether it is an arbitration or mediation, it also houses some of the world’s top legal thought leaders – WIPO, PCA, ICC, AAA-ICDR, INSOL. They all have offices at Maxwell Chambers. We believe in them, we support many of these organisations in setting up, sometimes subventing the office space. Because we believe in the value of having thought leaders from around the world in Singapore collaborate with us, think of ideas, and also come to speak to us about changes that they see on the horizon that might impact the way in which we organise ourselves and develop our policies.

{:start="47"}	
47. It is also important that Singapore looks at the multilateral world and continue to play our part in supporting the rules-based model on a global scale. So we have played a part in the Singapore Convention on Mediation in 2018, the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (or BBNJ) Agreement in 2023 that was signed after many years of negotiation, and more recently, the WIPO Treaty on Intellectual Property, Genetic Resources, and Associated Traditional Knowledge. These and other examples demonstrate and underscore Singapore’s commitment to a rules-based order, as well as to the international legal community.

{:start="48"}	
48. This international outlook is also seen in our courts. We continue to engage our foreign counterparts. We continue to be engaged in dialogue. We look at collaborative measures to ensure that our judicial system is also plugged into developments and advancements around the rest of the world.

{:start="49"}	
49. To give you one example, we are a proud member of the Judicial Insolvency Network (JIN). This helps to facilitate cross-border insolvency disputes, by allowing insolvency courts, even if you might not have rights of audience for foreign counsel in all jurisdictions, it allows the insolvency courts, to share documents, to share information, and on some occasion, through the use of technology, have joint hearings. So you might have a hearing in Singapore, and you might have a foreign court dial in by electronic means, on Zoom or Skype, and conduct the hearing jointly. So that, on common issues, as I said, we do not allow parties to arbitrage against one another.

{:start="50"}	
50. Last year, our Parliament passed legislation to establish the International Committee of the SICC, a designated body in Singapore, comprising local and international judges that will hear appeals of international commercial cases from prescribed foreign courts. The first collaboration under this model is between Singapore and Bahrain, as a model for future partnerships, which we are open to exploring.

**V. Conclusion**

{:start="51"}	
51. As I wrap up, let me just make a few comments on what I see as the future of litigation. Previously coming from the litigation community, I guess I am somewhat biased, but I believe in the resilience and adaptability of the litigation community.

{:start="52"}	
52. We have seen the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the 2009 Lehman crisis, the 2020 COVID-19, and I just outlined, in the last decade, a series of significant global disruptors. We have adapted, we have adjusted, and we have taken on new work in a new paradigm in new jurisdictions. There might be technology and AI in dispute resolution. There might be newer modalities. There might be new areas like the green economy and green financing, which perhaps were not present 10, 15 years ago. But the litigation community has taken them on board.

{:start="53"}	
53. The one secret sauce to all of this, I believe, is in networking. That is why a session like today is so important. An old friend once told me this – knowledge is good, know-how is better, but “know who” is best. Today’s session is really about the “know who”. As you network, you make friends and develop contacts from different parts of the world, practising different areas of law. I think that is all so important.

{:start="54"}	
54. Besides what Dinesh said earlier, I encourage you to take some time outside of the formal programme to make friends, to build contacts and to expand those networks. I think you will become truly invaluable in a world that is oftentimes fragmented by very insular and very navel-gazing perspectives. I wish all of you the very best.

{:start="55"}	
55. Wearing now my culture and art ministry hat, take some time to enjoy the cultural enclave that is literally a short hop away from this hotel, which itself has deep significant cultural and heritage history. Thank you very much.
