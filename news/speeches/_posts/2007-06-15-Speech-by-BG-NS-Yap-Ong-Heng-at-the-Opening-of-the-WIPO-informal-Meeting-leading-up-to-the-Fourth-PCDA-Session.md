*A very good morning to all of you* 
<br>  
1. On behalf of the Government of Singapore, let me welcome all of you to this Singapore Meeting. We are indeed honoured to host this important meeting as a lead-up to the fourth PCDA session in Geneva next month.

**Singapore Meeting**

{:start="2"}
2. At the last PCDA session in Geneva in February this year, WIPO member countries had successfully arrived at a consensus on the first group of 40 of the 111 PCDA proposals. The general view was that the success of that session had been aided by the preparatory meeting which was held in New Delhi, India.

3. It is our hope that the Meeting held here would emulate the success of the New Delhi Meeting. There is important work to be done over the next three days, and with the effort and cooperation of all present there would expectantly be progress on the remaining 71 proposals at hand.

{:start="4"}
4. It bears reiteration that, as was done in New Delhi, the proceedings over the coming days will be conducted in an informal manner. While we seek to promote a convergence of views, no decisions of any kind would be made. This meeting is an opportunity for us to help clarify and deepen our understanding of the substance of the 71 proposals before us. With this, the discussions can serve as valuable preparatory work for the upcoming PCDA session in Geneva. In fact, depending on how the discussions evolve, we might see the emergence of some tentative consensus on the 71 proposals. This will be helpful to the PCDA process.

{:start="5"}
5. Indeed, as we go about discussing the proposals in the next three days, we should constantly bear in mind the need to take shared ownership of the process. This is crucial, as agreeing on the process will pave the way for consensus in substance.

{:start="6"}
6. It is certainly a privilege for Singapore to play our part in contributing to the PCDA process. In this regard, I am also heartened to see Geoffrey Yu taking charge of the proceedings over the series of meetings. With all his experience in international consensus-building as a former senior WIPO official, I am sure he will be able to steer the meetings in a way that makes for constructive and meaningful discussions.

**Notes of Appreciation**

{:start="7"}
7. I would like to take this opportunity to thank WIPO for the cooperation and assistance it has extended to the Government of Singapore in making this meeting possible. This is yet another demonstration of the warm and close ties, and the productive and beneficial cooperation we have with WIPO.

{:start="8"}
8. Allow me to also thank all the participants who have traveled all the way here from Geneva or their respective countries. I would particularly like to extend our appreciation to Ambassador Clarke and the session chairpersons as well as the speakers who will be facilitating the discussions that follow. I am confident that with your active participation, the meeting will be an enriching and constructive experience for one and all.

**Singapore Hospitality**

{:start="9"}
9. But as you give of your time and effort to the meeting, do also take some time to experience our hospitality and what Singapore has to offer: the colours, the sights and sounds, as well as the textures and flavours. By the end of your stay, I hope that you will leave Singapore with not just the satisfaction of having completed a meaningful round of discussions, but also with fond memories of our city and country.

{:start="10"}
10. It leaves me to wish you a fruitful and productive meeting. Thank you.
