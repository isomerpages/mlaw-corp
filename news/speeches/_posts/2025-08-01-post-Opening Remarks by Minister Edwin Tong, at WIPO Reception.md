Excellencies,<br>
Ladies and Gentlemen,

{:start="1"}
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good afternoon, and a very warm welcome to all of you.

{:start="2"}
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am very happy to have with us, Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Mr Daren Tang, who is seeking re-election for a second term in 2026.

{:start="3"}
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Singapore nominated Daren for his first term as WIPO DG in 2019, it seems quite awhile ago, pre-COVID, it was the first time we had nominated a Singaporean for the leadership position of a major UN body.

{:start="4"}
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had done so, because of Singapore’s unwavering and firm commitment to support and strengthen the multilateral system, this is the system that underpins international efforts to protect and advance the global commons.

{:start="5"}
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am grateful that many countries represented here today supported Daren in 2020. Your support was not just a vote of confidence for Singapore, but also, a resounding affirmation of the commitment, to ensure that IP continues to facilitate economic and social development, and is accessible and relevant for the man-in-the-street.

{:start="6"}
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The post-World War II liberal world order that has delivered 80 years of economic development is today, under severe stress. The world has become more dangerous, and economic uncertainty has worsened.

{:start="7"}
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this challenging environment, it is critical that international organisations are led by leaders who are able to navigate the geo-political and geo-economic complexities in today’s world. This leader must also strengthen multilateralism, and ensure that these institutions continue to deliver tangible benefits for all Member States and their people.

{:start="8"}
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that Daren is such a leader, and we seek your government’s support for Daren’s re-election as WIPO DG for a second term.

{:start="9"}
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since assuming office in October 2020, Daren has worked tirelessly to anchor WIPO as the global institution protecting IP rights, as well as promoting innovation and creativity.

{:start="10"}
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daren has also transformed the global IP ecosystem by reorienting WIPO from focusing on IP as a legal and somewhat technical subject matter, to leveraging IP to deliver tangible economic and social benefits to Member States.

{:start="11"}
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Daren’s leadership, WIPO successfully concluded two treaties in 2024, the&nbsp; Genetic Resources and Associated Traditional Knowledge (GRATK) and the Riyadh Design Law Treaty (RDLT). This is a significant achievement, given that the last WIPO treaty was concluded over a decade ago.

{:start="12"}
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daren has implemented organisational transformation to build a more open, consultative and overall, a far more collaborative WIPO Secretariat. He has also ensured good governance, which is the foundation and core of every successful organisation. He has also sought to ensure that WIPO remains in good financial health.

{:start="13"}
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore is gratified and honoured by the overwhelming support and positive response to Daren’s first term as WIPO DG. We are also encouraged and grateful for the many early expressions of support, that we have received from friends, including the African Group, France, Japan, and the UAE.

{:start="14"}
14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I wrap up today’s speech, I respectfully seek you and your country’s continued support for a second term for Daren. We hope to complete the transformational journey he started back in 2020, to ensure that WIPO continues to deliver, as I said, tangible economic and social outcomes for all Member States through the use of intellectual property.

{:start="15"}
15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much and I formally welcome you again to today’s session, and I look forward to chatting with you as we make our way around later this afternoon.
