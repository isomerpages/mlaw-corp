**I. Introduction**

{:start="1"}
1.  A really good morning to all of you. We are very privileged to host all of you in Singapore. I would like to echo what the previous speakers have said about how, despite this being held in Asia for the first time, we have such a diverse attendance of 320 members from 48 different jurisdictions. I am told that we have representation from all continents of the world, except Antarctica!.

{:start="2"}
2. I am really heartened by this strong, diverse turnout, because I really believe that we do need to come together regularly to exchange ideas, share best practices, and on occasions like this, to make new connections and refresh old ones. I call this “de-Zoomification”. We used to, in the COVID era, rely on the efficiency of being able to see each other across continents on Zoom. But whilst it might make for good educational or academic connections, I think it does not make for relational or social connections, which are really so important in our practice as fellow litigators at the Bar.

{:start="3"}	
3. This is all the more important today, when the world is becoming increasingly fragmented and divided. When countries are really seeking to turn away from win-win cooperation, and deeper integration, I think it becomes even more crucial for the people, including all of us here today, to stay united.

**II. The Future of the World**

{:start="4"}	
4. I was a litigator at Allen &amp; Gledhill for 25 years. The topic that I was asked to speak on this morning – the future of litigation – is tantalisingly simple. What is the future like? But I think it is also complex, given what we have seen around the world today.

{:start="5"}	
5. We have known for some time now that the world is in a state of flux – increasingly uncertain, unsettled, unstable. The rules-based multilateral trading system, which has allowed so many countries to prosper and progress for the last 80 years, in fact since the end of the second World War, is quickly being eroded.

{:start="6"}	
6. In the last decade alone, we have seen many global events, which have disrupted the world order, divided the world, and changed the way in which we see practice. For example, Brexit in 2016; the US-China trade war, which started growing at a quick pace from 2018; the COVID-19 pandemic, which struck the world in 2020; the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022; and the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas-led Palestinian militant groups in 2023 – some of these man-made, others are not.

{:start="7"}	
7. Many international organisations have sounded the alert on rising geopolitical tensions, and the resulting fragmentation of the global economy. This includes the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the World Economic Forum (WEF), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as well as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

{:start="8"}	
8. Their messages have, over the last few years, been very consistent. The declining support for free trade and open market will shrink global GDP, and we have seen the impact of some of this on the smaller economies in particular. It will also reduce global output, impact the flow of trade, investment and capital, fuel inflation, and hinder progress and development.

{:start="9"}	
9. We have seen this bear out in the last few years. For example, just take the US-China trade war since 2018. This has contributed, in real terms, to a lowered aggregate real income in both the US and China. It has increased prices for US households by an average of US$1,200 per year. And it has also contributed, in no small means, to China’s slower GDP growth. So, it is a lose-lose situation for both, and in fact, more than both sides, with related parties like Singapore being caught in the crossfire.

{:start="10"}	
10. We also begin to see countries shift away from a rules-based response to such challenges.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) For example, the WTO dispute settlement system has been suspended since 2019, when its Appellate Body ceased to function. I think it is a serious sign when a rules-based system that is adjudicating disputes based on the rule of law has decided that it ought not or cannot function.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(2) Countries like Indonesia, Bolivia, Venezuela, South Africa have taken steps to either terminate their bilateral investment treaties (BITs), or reject the dispute settlement mechanisms in such agreements.</p>

{:start="11"}	
11. Businesses operating across borders thus find themselves without access to immediate legal recourse, whilst facing increasing number of trade restrictions imposed by parties.

{:start="12"}	
12. As all of you would be aware, the sheer scope and scale of trade restrictions have increased exponentially recently, with “Liberation Day” tariffs on all trading partners. Of course, we all woke up this morning to a 90-day pause, literally within hours of the tariffs coming into effect.

{:start="13"}	
13. Economists have calculated the average effective tariff rate to be over 23%. If you look at the original tariff announcements which have been suspended, these range from a minimum of 10% tariff on countries like Singapore, which was put on us, despite us having a trade deficit relationship with the US, to steep and perhaps intolerable levels for countries like China, which is the exception to the suspension that was announced overnight. We now look at tariffs at 125%. If you look at the volume of trade between the US and China, you can begin to calculate the consequential impact it will have on suppliers downstream, upstream, and related parties.

{:start="14"}	
14. Earlier this year, the IMF estimated that a universal rise of just 10% in US tariffs, accompanied by some measure of retaliation from China and from the EU, could reduce global GDP by about 0.5% through 2026. That was the impact of tariffs alone, excluding other inflationary trends.

{:start="15"}	
15. We have already begun to see the impact, although it has been less than a week since the “Liberation Day” announcements.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) Stock and equity markets have collapsed sharply after the 2nd April announcements. Of course, overnight, they have now soared – S&amp;P500, Dow. But the question that we have to ask ourselves is, is this rise back in value really based on value? Or was it based on volatile announcements that have been made? Uncertainty and unpredictability are concepts that the business community does not want or like. You can have bad news, you can understand down the road that there are changes in regulations or laws that affect the way in which you might do business. But volatility and unpredictability are completely anathema to open business concepts.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(2) China has now responded with its own reciprocal tariffs. It remains to be seen whether other countries will follow suit.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(3) Researchers from J.P. Morgan have increased their forecast of the risk of a global recession to 40%, up from 30% at the start of 2025.</p>

{:start="16"}	
16. What does this all mean for us?

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) In the short to medium term, we can expect a significant global decline in economic activity.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(2) Some of the multinational corporations and local businesses in Singapore – we keep in touch with the Singapore businesses in a very tight way, because they are on the pulse, they feel the ground, they feel the movements – and they tell us that they have put new projects on hold. They are assessing the full implications of the tariffs.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(3) I am sure similar conversations are happening right around the world.</p>

{:start="17"}	
17. That said, I believe, coming back to this topic today, that globalisation will survive. We are too advanced down that road on multilateralism, globalisation, having an open economy for this not to survive.

{:start="18"}	
18. It will have an impact on the future of litigation.

{:start="19"}	
19. Trade will no longer be guided by principles of economic efficiency and comparative advantage. Rather, issues such as political alignment and strategic considerations will begin to drive business considerations. There will be, in the near term, more “friend-shoring” and “near-shoring”. This, of course, will have impact on the contracts that we need to enforce.

{:start="20"}	
20. Businesses will react by seeking new and emerging markets, and will have to find a way to adapt to this new equilibrium. The new businesses may end up re-ordering around nodes and trusted business hubs, where networks of like-minded countries, bound together by political ideology and political support – rather than economic efficiency – might then drive trade behaviour.

{:start="21"}	
21. Therefore, while the shape of the new global system is still in a state of flux, still uncertain and still finding its level, there will, I believe, continue to be international commercial transactions within this new order. There will still be cross-border legal work and disputes.

{:start="22"}	
22. This brings me to the topic of the day – the future of litigation.

**III. The Future of Litigation**

{:start="23"}	
23. All of us as practitioners, I think we know law does not exist in a vacuum. It exists because there are commercial transactions. Law follows businesses.

{:start="24"}	
24. Hence, the increased global trade in the last few decades has corresponded to a rise in the internationalisation of commercial disputes. This is evidenced by the upward trend in the volume of cross-border investment and commercial disputes handled by international institutions right around the world. I think we will need our dispute resolution institutions to serve more and more of the international community.

{:start="25"}	
25. Let me give you some examples:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(1) I am sure similar conversations are happening right around the world.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(2) I am sure similar conversations are happening right around the world.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">(3) I am sure similar conversations are happening right around the world.</p>

{:start="26"}	
26. Indeed, we all know from seeing the many cases, that when individuals and families encounter legal problems, they might not start as a legal problem. Often, they do not. We find ourselves having to go beyond providing legal aid and assistance. Sometimes, they help seekers who come to us, they require financial assistance.

{:start="27"}	
27. Very often, they require a stronger social support network, and this is where our pro bono volunteers sometimes offer counselling, oftentimes also mental health interventions. And both lawyers, as well as those from other professions, including the social service professionals, have been contributing their time, talent, their own expertise to provide more holistic support to those in need.

{:start="28"}	
28. If we were to ask any of the pro bono lawyers here this evening, I am sure that all of them will be able to share how much they have touched the lives of the individuals and families, showing that our volunteers go the extra mile to journey with the clients – not just through legal challenges, but also life’s challenges, showing empathy and providing care, as any counsellor or friend would.

{:start="29"}	
29. I am very glad that all of us present here today share this ethos of compassion and service for all, especially for the most vulnerable amongst us in our society.

{:start="30"}	
30. Pro Bono SG organised the inaugural Pro Bono Weeks earlier this year, which culminated in the Just Jalan charity walk. Just Jalan means just walk. But I understand some of you have that competitive spirit in you and the walk turned into jogs and runs. This is a great way to rally the legal fraternity and other partners for a good cause. I want to say that it is not just the local Bar, but also our foreign law firms, who have played a big part in Just Jalan as well as the other related programmes.

{:start="31"}	
31. Recently, I attended the opening of Freshfields’ new and expanded office in Singapore. As you know, with every office opening, there tends to be fanfare and oftentimes, the guests at these openings walk away with a door gift. But this time round, they decided that in lieu of door gifts, they donated $45 per guest who attended to Pro Bono SG – to represent 45 years since Freshfields first set up in Singapore in 1980. I thought this
was a very wonderful gesture – so thank you, Freshfields.

{:start="32"}	
32. Pro Bono SG has also worked with DLA Piper and the Singapore Corporate Counsel Association to develop the Singapore In-House Legal Counsel Pro Bono Guide, which was released earlier this year. I hope it will inspire and empower even more in-house counsels to integrate pro bono work into their practice.

**V. Conclusion**

{:start="33"}	
33. Finally, I thought I would conclude with a quote from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a leading legal jurist, who is also activist, who was on the United States’ Supreme Court bench. She said, “Lawyers have a license to practice law for monopoly on certain services. But for that privilege and status, lawyers have an obligation to provide legal services to those without the wherewithal to pay, to respond to needs outside themselves, to help
repair tears in their communities.”

{:start="34"}	
34. I thought this was a very meaningful quote because it reflects what we do, and more importantly, why we do it.

{:start="35"}	
35. As we commemorate 60 years of independence (SG60) this year, I think we can all reflect on the spirit of community and care that lies at the heart of our nation.

{:start="36"}	
36. I think in this regard, the work that has been done by Pro Bono SG, as well as all the constituents, organisations, really deserves a special mention.

{:start="37"}	
37. This evening, we will honour the invaluable contributions of the many volunteers, donors and partners, who have played a crucial role in helping us strengthen our justice system and help us to continue to anchor delivery of pro bono services and most importantly, to ensure our legal system remains open and accessible to all. This dedication and compassion ensure that justice is not just a privilege for some.

{:start="38"}	
38. So I thank all of you very much for being here, for being a big part of Pro Bono SG’s work, and for your generous contributions.

{:start="39"}	
39. Thank you very much.
