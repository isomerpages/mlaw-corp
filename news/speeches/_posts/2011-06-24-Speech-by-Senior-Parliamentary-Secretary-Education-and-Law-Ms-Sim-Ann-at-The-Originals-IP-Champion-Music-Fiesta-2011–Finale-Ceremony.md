Mr Quek Tong Boon, Chairman of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS),
Mr Tan Yih San, Chief Executive of IPOS,
Mr Tan Hang Cheong, Principal of Singapore Polytechnic,
Mrs Woo Soo Min, Principal of Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School,
Distinguished guests,
Parents, educators, students and competitors,

1. Good evening. I am delighted to join all of you for the finale of "The Originals" Intellectual Property (IP) Champion Music Fiesta 2011.  Tonight marks the culmination of a four-day journey of learning about IP in a fun and creative environment. I am sure it has been intensive yet exciting for all of you.

2. This camp is jointly organised by the Honour Intellectual Property (HIP) Alliance, which is the flagship public outreach initiative of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), together with Singapore Polytechnic and Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School. The purpose of this camp is for all of you to gain first-hand experience in creating intellectual property and then protecting your ideas and creative expressions in a fun and interactive manner.

3. Since its inception in 2004, the IP Champion Camp has steadily grown in scale and involvement.  In 2004, we had 55 participants from nine schools. This year, 145 students from 21 schools participated. 

4.This IP Champion Camp is part of IPOS' ongoing efforts to bring IP closer to the people.  At every Camp, all participants undergo a learning journey that enables them to appreciate that the original and creative expression of music and other art forms are IP which creative artists hold dearly and seek to protect. IP protection ensures that artists in the creative industry are rewarded for their hard work and they are in turn inspired to produce even more creative works for all of us to enjoy.  This is a key pillar towards building a buoyant creative industry in Singapore, and it is one of the things that keeps our economy special. 

5. As the Camp evolve over the years, our participants get to try their hand at different things. In previous years, we created comic strips and sculpted clay. This year’s Camp is about composing original songs. Through sharing sessions with music practitioners, artists and the hands-on experience of music creation, I am sure many of you now have a much more personal appreciation for IP.  

6. This evening, we have all been treated to the wonderful performances of the many talented students here. All of you have personified this year's competition theme – "What it means to be Original". I am sure that your passion in music will continue. 

7. This year, the winning team will not only clinch the "Minister for Law Challenge Trophy" for their school, but will also be awarded a two-week internship at renowned local recording studio, Ocean Butterflies Music. I am sure the team will make good use of this opportunity to gain invaluable experience and insight.

8. Before we announce the results of this year's IP Champion Camp, let me take this opportunity to thank our co-organisers, Singapore Polytechnic – School of Digital Media and Infocomm Technology, and the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Creative Arts – Music Satellite at Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School, your help has made this camp possible.

9. I would also like to thank our partners, Recording Industry Association (Singapore) and Ocean Butterflies Music, for their strong support.

10. Last but not least, I would like to commend all participants for your enthusiasm and effort in making the camp a success. After today's event, I hope you will help to share the importance of protecting IP with your family and friends and fans and make a stand to support "The Originals". 

11. Thank you.
