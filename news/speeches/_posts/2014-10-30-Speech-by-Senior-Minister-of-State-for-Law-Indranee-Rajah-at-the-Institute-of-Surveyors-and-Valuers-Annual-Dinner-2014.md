Mr Loi Hwee Yong and Mr Silas Loh, Presidents, SISV,  
Members of SISV,  
Ladies and gentlemen.  

<p style="margin-left: 18px; font-weight:bold">Introduction</p>

 1. Thank you very much for inviting me and I am happy to join you for tonight's occasion. 

 2. In this hall tonight, there are professionals in the fields of quantity surveying, land surveying, valuation, property management and real estate consultancy. The range of expertise which SISV provides is immense. The work you do touches the lives of every Singaporean. You have made significant contributions to Singapore’s built environment and helped build a cityscape we can all be proud of. 
    
    **Need to Unlock Full Potential of Limited Land**


 3. As a small country, we must unlock the full potential of our limited land. To do so, we must continue to be at the forefront of innovation in urban development. This relentless pursuit of excellence and innovation is not an option – it is a necessity. Creative approaches to use our land more efficiently will become even more important in the future as we continue to develop.


 4. We have done well so far. In the last few years alone, a number of bold and visionary projects have been completed, which demonstrate Singaporeans’ creativity and ability to push the boundaries. These include the Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Coastal Expressway, and most recently the Jurong Rock Caverns.


 5. In the years to come, advancements in technology will yield many exciting new possibilities. Underground development will be one of the next frontiers. Underground developments, such as the Jurong Rock Caverns, have demonstrated that deep underground development is technologically possible and safe, and can be used to create many opportunities for Singapore. There will of course be challenges to overcome and risks to manage as we quite literally break new ground.


 6. Every Singaporean can play a part in this exciting endeavour. The Government is actively seeking good ideas from the industry and the public on how to better develop our city. For instance, new apps on OneMap are being developed to allow the public to post comments and multimedia that are tagged to a map. The Cat Welfare Association, for instance, was able to get the public to locate street cats in the community and to care for them through one such app. 


 7. The Singapore Land Authority also partnered with volunteers from the Rail Corridor Watch Group to improve the experience for Rail Corridor users. Thanks to such efforts, the Rail Corridor has become a popular recreational space. 
    
    **Need for Strong Legal Frameworks and Policies**


 8. New and creative ideas for land use to support our nation’s development must be supported by progressive and robust legal frameworks and policies. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight several recent amendments to the legislation which might be of interest to you – in particular amendments to the Land Acquisition Act.


 9. The Land Acquisition Act has been pivotal to Singapore’s development. The Government recognises the impact on property owners affected by land acquisition. Hence, we have and will continue to enhance the compensation framework and land acquisition process. 


10. The Act was amended in 2007 to provide for compensation based on market value of the acquired land. This year, we made further changes to revise the application of the betterment levy. Increase in the value of the remaining land due to the acquisition scheme, will no longer be deducted from the compensation for the partially acquired land.


11. We have also allowed the Management Corporation of strata-titled developments to act on behalf of individual unit owners when there are acquisitions of Common Property in the development. This will save time and effort for all parties.


12. Also, the Appeals Board will now have the power, similar to the powers of the Courts, to order costs against non-parties, such as valuers and solicitors who unnecessarily or unreasonably prolong the proceedings or add to the legal costs incurred. 
    
    **Need to Unlock Full Potential of Our People**


13. I have spoken about the need to push ourselves to use land more creatively, and to have strong legal frameworks to support national development. Importantly, we must also provide our people with opportunities to reach their fullest potential. On that front, I would like to commend the efforts of SISV, in facilitating training for your industry. 


14. For instance, in the field of land surveying, I understand that SISV had garnered the support from ITE and WDA, and will provide land surveying training at certificate level. As part of this programme, participants will have time off from work two days a week to attend the training. Pleased to hear that the first batch of trainees is expected next year.


15. Also, I understand that the first batch of graduates from the part-time diploma course in Geospatial Information and Technology graduated this year. Graduates from the programme will have better career opportunities, and also be able to gain advance standing into one of the related degree programmes accredited by the Land Surveyors Board.  


16. I am pleased that these initiatives are in line with the recommendations of the ASPIRE committee, which I chair. They are part of our nation-wide push to place stronger emphasis on skills and applied learning, and for continual and lifelong learning. 
    
    **Conclusion**


17. In conclusion, let me say that in a world where size is ordinarily correlated with influence, Singapore can and will continue to punch above its weight, as long as we innovate in our use of land, put in place strong legal frameworks and help our people realise their full potential. With boldness and imagination, and strong partnerships between Government, industry, and the public, I am confident that we can look forward to many more exciting possibilities in the years to come.


18. I wish you all an enjoyable evening. Thank you for inviting me.
