1. The Honourable Attorney-General, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, a very good morning to all of you. 

2. It is apt as we celebrate 35 years of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) that just a couple of weeks  ago, we had a report in the local papers about the archaeological artefacts found at Empress Place, not far from here. Porcelain crockery, figurines and wooden planks dating back to the 14th Century were found. Now those of you from countries around the region and beyond who have temples and palaces stretching back to 1000 years or more may with good reason wonder what the fuss is all about. But for us Singaporeans it is a reminder that while our modern city is relatively young, we can trace back the existence of a trading port here much further into the past. Trade and commerce is literally in our soil.

3. And indeed, historians are agreed that there was a sizeable amount of trade between Southeast Asia, all the way in one direction, to China and Okinawa, and in the other, through India and the Arabian Peninsula, to Egypt and the Roman, Byzantine and Venetian Empires. Gold, tin, wood, spices, cloth, crockery, pottery, all flowed through a silk road of the sea. Trade has been the lifeblood of the region, from the ancient traders on the Plain of Jars in Lao, to the sea-going merchants from Sulawesi in Indonesia, to the renowned potters of Sukhothai.

4. Now, we can probably never know what laws governed trade in Southeast Asia then. There are in Europe records of lex mercatoria in various forms. In contrast, written historical records have rarely survived in our heat and humidity. But it would be likely that there was some sort of common law of trade, some generally accepted principles governing these traders. 

5. In that light therefore, this seminar is but a continuation of a very long tradition of trying to seek commonality of practice in law, so as to facilitate trade and commerce, for the benefit of all.  

6. This commemoration and celebration of 35 years of the CISG will, as you know, cover a wide range of issues relating to the CISG and its relevance for Singapore and the region. The CISG has the potential to facilitate and encourage greater commerce by ensuring better understanding and commonality of the legal rules governing contracts concerning cross-border trade. We hope to see greater adoption across our partners in the region. Meetings such as this play a crucial role in furthering understanding among government officials, academics and legal advisers about the potential benefits of the CISG, as well as the potential areas of improvement. We are indeed grateful that many of the speakers and participants are from the private bar. It is essential in meetings such as these that we have a full spectrum of views and experiences, from the government to the university to the legal offices.

7. In Singapore, the Ministry of Law is committed to exploring further ways Singapore can put in place a legal framework to support and encourage trade. Singapore is proud to be a committed member of UNCITRAL. Apart from actively participating in the work of the UNCITRAL Working Groups, Singapore also advocates the adoption of UNCITRAL texts among our ASEAN partners. We at the Ministry appreciate the opportunity to work with UNCITRAL on this seminar and be part of this conversation today and tomorrow, taking on board views not just about the CISG and its implementation in Singapore, but ways we can improve our commercial legal framework overall. There may also be a greater impetus for the convergence of commercial law.  Such a development cannot be the fruit of labour of just one country; it requires cooperation and discussion among all the nations of the region. Our Ministry is committed to play an active part in helping to realise that vision.

8. On these issues and others, I am sure that this Seminar will have a long lasting impact. I thank all of the speakers for contributing their time and effort, and the organisers for the immaculate planning. I am certain that this Seminar will be another successful milestone in the journey to build a more certain, and more supportive legal framework for trade and commerce, not just in this region but also the world over.  

9. On this note, I wish everyone a fruitful and engaging meeting. 

10. Thank you.
