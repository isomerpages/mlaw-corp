Your Excellency Minister of Justice and Keeper of the Seals of the French Republic, Éric Dupond-Moretti,
<br>Your Excellency, Ambassador of France to Singapore Marc Abensour
<br>Your Excellency, Ambassador of Singapore to the French Republic Zainal Arif Mantaha,
<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen,
<br><br>Good afternoon and good morning to our friends in Paris.
<br><br>
<u>Introduction</u>

<ol start="1">
<li>Singapore and France share deep and strong relations.</li>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>In 2012, we upgraded our relations to a Strategic Partnership. Our relations have reached new heights ever since; </li>
<li>Most recently in 2018, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was President Macron’s Guest of Honour during France’s National Celebrations;</li>
<li>High-level exchanges take place on a regular basis; </li>
<li>France is also Singapore’s second largest goods trading partner in the EU; and  </li>
<li>Many leading French Companies – Airbus, L’Oréal, Louis Vuitton, Schneider Electric, Thales, to name a few, have established a base in Singapore as their gateway to access growth opportunities in Asia.</li>

</ol>
</li></ol>


<ol start="2">
<li>In July 2016 on the sidelines of the 11th Asia-Europe Summit in Mongolia, Prime Minister Lee and the former French Prime Minister and then-French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault agreed to step up legal cooperation between Singapore and France. </li></ol>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>This year, we are seeing the results of our strengthened legal cooperation:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>In January this year, we had the inaugural Singapore-France Legal Symposium that was held at the Supreme Court of Singapore;</li>
<li>Two MOUs were signed at this Symposium </li></ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li>The first was between the Singapore Academy of Law and the Sorbonne-Assas International Law School, to jointly offer learning and development programmes to the legal community in Singapore and more importantly in this region; </li>
<li>The second, between the Law Society of Singapore and the Paris Bar Association, facilitates the exchange of information between both countries on the practice of the legal profession. </ol>
</li></ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Today, we have now come together for an important step forward in strengthening our legal cooperation, with the signing of the agreement on mutual legal assistance.</li></ol>

<br><b><u>Significance of the Agreement</b></u>

<ol start="5">
<li>The signing of this Agreement builds on the strong foundation of our existing relationship. </li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We already cooperate closely on mutual legal assistance requests.</li>
<li>In fact, our law enforcement agencies have regular exchanges on issues relating to counter terrorism, cybercrime, homeland security, amongst many others. </li></ol> </ol>
 
<ol start="6">
<li>What is significant, is a clear directive on my part and my ministry to do this Agreement quickly. In fact, it is our first mutual legal assistance treaty since 2005 – since the last 15 years.</li>
 <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Our laws already allow us to provide mutual legal assistance on the basis of reciprocity even without a treaty; </li>
<li>But we recognise the value of formalising mutual legal assistance arrangements with trusted partners. In this case, France.</li></ol> </ol>

<ol start="7">
<li> This Agreement is also our first bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty with a country with a civil law system.</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Despite the differences in our legal heritage, we were able to negotiate and resolve the text of this Agreement after just three rounds of negotiations. </li>
<li>This is due to the trust that we have between our two countries, between our officials, and of course due to the hard work of the officials involved. </li>
<li>Also, it is a testament to the commitment of both countries in the fight against crime. 
</li></ol>
</ol>

<ol start="8">
<li>We think that this instrument will help in today’s era of rapid communication and international trade, which can be exploited by criminal networks.</li> 
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>An effective network of international cooperation is needed to deal with criminal organisations, because national authorities alone will find it difficult to deal with them.</li></ol>
</ol>
<br><b><u>Features of the Agreement</b></u>

<ol start="9">
<li>The Agreement sets out a framework and agreed standards for a range of mutual legal assistance between both countries. </li></ol>

<ol start="10">
<li>They include:</li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The obtaining of evidence such as bank records or witness testimony; </li>
<li>Restraining and confiscating the proceeds of crime; and</li>
<li>The search and seizure of evidence. </li></ol>
</ol>

<ol start="11">
<li>This Agreement will further cement the already strong relationship and mutual legal assistance that our two countries give to each other.</li></ol>
<br><b><u>Conclusion</b></u>

<ol start="12">
<li>The signing of this Agreement is an important step for us as a responsible member of the international community, and </li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Demonstrates our commitment to facilitating greater international cooperation in the fight against transnational crime. 
</li></ol></ol>

<ol start="13">
<li>Excellency, I am pleased to sign this Agreement via videoconference. </li>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>This is a novel approach. It does not allow COVID-19 to stop us from carrying on with what we need to do. </li>
<li>I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those who have contributed to making this Agreement and signing ceremony possible. </li>
<li>I am certain that the relations built in this experience has placed us in good stead for the further strengthening of our legal cooperation. </li> </ol>
</ol>

<ol start="14">
<li>Thank you.</li></ol>
