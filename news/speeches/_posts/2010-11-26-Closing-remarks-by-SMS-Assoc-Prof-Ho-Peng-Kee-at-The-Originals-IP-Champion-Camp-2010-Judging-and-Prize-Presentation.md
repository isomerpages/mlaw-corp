Ms Liew Woon Yin, Director-General of IPOS  
Mrs Tang-Chan Yueh Tarn, Principal of Springfield Secondary School  
Mr Sing Seng Hwa, Vice-Principal, Springfield Secondary School  
Mr Ban Yinh Jheow, CEO, Stikfas Pte Ltd  
Mr David Tay, Director, Kingsmen Out-of-Home Media  
Guests and students,  

1. Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's prize presentation.

2. This year, the winner will spend two-weeks of internship with Kingsmen to try to make their product even better. Last year, I saw Joie's product - a six-frame comic strip which was turned into an animation.

3. Basically, the key thing after this camp is that you realise that you can produce something. I have seen some of your products â€“ your creations were wonderful. And more importantly, this brings home the point that when you do something like this, what is involved in terms of the process -you have the idea, inspiration, a sense of creativity, and then you will have to make it happen.

4. When you create a song or a book or any other creative item, a lot of effort is involved. Many Singaporeans actually do these things as a living. For example, Ratonel, who won the second place in Singapore Idol, and others like her- ordinary Singaporeans who realised that they want to make a living out of creating things. That may happen to you too, in the near future.

5. But to do that, you will have to respect IP. I know that for young people, piracy may be cheaper or cool. But I can tell you that it's not cool, because it is wrong. We are depriving somebody of something that he or she is entitled to, which is the commission or the royalties of the product.

6. Of course, the larger picture is, IP is what made Singapore. As you know, Singapore has attracted a lot of business. And because of our strong IP regime, your aviation companies, your creative companies come to Singapore. So that's what makes it important too.

7. After this camp, maybe we can try working with your principals, your school authorities, to give you an opportunity to share, either at school assembly time or some other opportunities, about your experience and what you have learnt, about how IP is important to Singapore. So let's do that because looking back, it would be something where you have benefitted, whether personally or as a Singaporean.

8. So, on this note, thank you once again everybody for making this possible. I know it is not easy to organise a three-day camp. I do hope each of you brings with you the message that you must respect IP.

9. You know when I meet my counterparts, fellow ministers in charge of IP all over the world, we always talk about young people, how important it is to impress upon young people the respect for IP. And Singapore has come a long way.

10. HIP Alliance honours IP but we still have to work it, work it, work it. So every year, IPOS thinks about new ways to convey this message in a challenging way that impacts young people.

11. But the best way, as they say, is peer pressure. So, please get out there and tell even your parents about it. Tell your neighbours, tell your brothers, tell your parents, tell other people, that "yes, it cost a bit more but let's buy the original and respect IP".

12. So on this note, congratulations to all of you, and I really hope that having seen what you can do, you will be inspired to make more creations.

13. Thank you and all the best.
