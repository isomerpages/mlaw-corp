**Public Consultation on Draft Regulations for Collective Management Organisations**
---

**Consultation Period:**  
7 November 2022 to 4 December 2022

MinLaw and IPOS are seeking views on the draft Copyright (Collective Management Organisations) Regulations 2023 (“Regulations”). 

The draft Regulations set out the licence conditions which collective management organisations (“CMOs”) must comply with under a mandatory class licensing scheme administered by IPOS, as well as procedural matters relating to the regulation of CMOs. The draft Regulations are available as Annex A (link below).

**Background**

This consultation is part of an ongoing review of Singapore’s copyright regime, specifically on the introduction of a class licensing scheme for CMOs. It follows from earlier consultations on proposed amendments to our copyright regime, including a consultation conducted in 2020 on the collective rights management ecosystem (“2020 Consultation”). The 2020 Consultation paper is available as Annex B (link below).

The draft Regulations implement the proposals made at the 2020 Consultation and take in the feedback received on those proposals at that consultation. This technical consultation seeks views on the language of the draft Regulations, in particular feedback on:

- Legal clarity and/or workability; and
- Operational and implementation issues.
