Responses to feedback received from public consultation on the International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill
---

**Consultation Period:**  
27 Jul 2009 to 17 Aug 2009

The Ministry of Law held a public consultation from 27 July to 17 August 2009 on the International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill. We received submissions from lawyers, academics and industry experts. These submissions were in general supportive of the amendments and provided suggestions on how the legislation could be further fine-tuned.
