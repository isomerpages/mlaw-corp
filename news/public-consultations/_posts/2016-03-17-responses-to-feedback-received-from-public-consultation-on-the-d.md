Public consultation on legislative amendments to the Bankruptcy Act in in relation to the Debt Repayment Scheme
---

**Consultation Period:**  
17 Mar 2016 to 28 Apr 2016

1. The Ministry of Law held a public consultation on the proposed introduction of a Mediation Bill. We received submissions from various sources, including mediation practitioners, service providers, and other stakeholders in the mediation industry, lawyers and the general public, on how the legislation could be further refined.

2. We would like to thank all respondents for their feedback. The Ministry of Law has carefully considered all suggestions received, and has incorporated some of the suggestions in the Mediation Bill where appropriate. A summary of responses to key feedback is enclosed at **[Annex A](/files/Responses_to_feedback_received_from_Public_Consultation_on_the_Draft_Mediation_Bill.pdf)**{:target="_blank"}(198KB).
