**Public Consultation on the Proposed Copyright Bill**
---

**Consultation Period:**  
5 February 2021 to 1 April 2021

MinLaw and IPOS are seeking views on the draft of a proposed Copyright Bill ("draft Bill") to be introduced. The draft Bill will replace the current Copyright Act (Cap. 60, Rev. Ed. 2006).

**Background**

This consultation is part of an overall review of Singapore's copyright regime. Public consultations were held on various proposals for amendments to the regime in 2016 and 2017, and a report was published in 2019 setting out our recommendations. A further consultation on a class licensing scheme for collective management organisations ("CMOs") was held in 2020 pursuant to the recommendations in the 2019 Report.

**Purpose of consultation**

This consultation seeks views on whether the draft Bill will appropriately implement the changes that have been set out in the 2019 Report. We would particularly welcome feedback on:

- Operational and implementation issues
- Legal clarity and/or workability
- Language and structure

At this point in time, we are not seeking views on the policy positions set out in the 2019 Report or any refinements that we have made to those positions in the course of preparing the draft Bill, save where otherwise indicated in the public consultation papers linked below.

**Structure of public consultation**

This public consultation will take place in two Parts. The first Part will focus on the draft Bill, while the second Part will be released on 22 February and will seek views on the framework for regulating CMOs. The consultation for both Parts will end together on 1 April 2021.

**Providing feedback**

MinLaw and IPOS invite members of the public, particularly legal practitioners, academics, and affected stakeholders, to provide their feedback from 5 February 2021 to 1 April 2021.
