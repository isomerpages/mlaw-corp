Public Consultation on Criminal Procedure Code Bill
---

**Consultation Period:**  
11 Dec 2008 to 28 Feb 2009

<b><sup>*</sup>Update: The consultation period has been extended to 28 February 2009.</b>

1. The Ministry of Law, together with the Attorney-General's Chambers and the Ministry of Home Affairs, are proposing the introduction of a Criminal Procedure Code Bill ("CPC Bill") to repeal and replace the current CPC. A copy of the draft CPC Bill is attached.

2. The proposed changes cover the following main areas:

<ol style = list-style-type:"lower-alpha">
  <li>Investigation and pre trial framework;</li>
  <li>Trial process;</li>
  <li>Post trial process; and</li>
  <li>Repeal of provisions on Coroners inquiries.</li>
</ol>

3. The CPC provides the regulatory framework for criminal investigations, trials and appeals, and other ancillary matters. While the current criminal justice system works well, we need to update current practices, but ensure that trial procedures remain easy to understand and navigable. As our society matures, it is also no longer optimal to rely purely on traditional punishments of fines, imprisonments or caning. Other countries have introduced community based sentences with success. We should introduce more graduated punishments for certain offences which will lead to better outcomes for both the individual and the State.

4. As a whole, the proposals will modernise our criminal justice framework, ensuring that it remains relevant in our current operating environment.

5. The Ministry invites interested parties to provide their feedback on the CPC Bill. The consultation period ends on 5 February 2009*. The feedback may be sent in electronic or hard copy form to:
