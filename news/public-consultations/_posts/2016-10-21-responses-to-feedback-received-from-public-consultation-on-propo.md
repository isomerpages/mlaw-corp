---

**Consultation Period:**  
21 Oct 2016 to 2 Dec 2016

1. The Ministry of Law held a public consultation from 21 Oct 2016 to 2 Dec 2016 on the proposed amendments to the Companies Act to enhance Singaporeâ€™s debt restructuring framework. We received feedback from various local and international respondents, including financial institutions, accountants, lawyers, professional associations and academics.

2. The Ministry of Law would like to thank all respondents for their feedback. Respondents provided views on substantive policy issues as well as drafting suggestions.  We have carefully considered all the suggestions received and have incorporated much of the feedback into a revised Bill.

3. The Ministry of Law has prepared a response to address feedback relevant to substantive policy issues, a copy of which is enclosed at [ANNEX A](/files/Annex_A-Goverment_Response_to_Public Consult_Feedback_for_Companies_Act_Amendments.pdf){:target="_blank"}(426 KB).
