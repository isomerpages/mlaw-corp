2.	At the close of the public consultation exercise, MinLaw and IPOS received 46 responses from stakeholders, including members of the public. Most respondents agreed that the draft bill was well-written and easier to understand than the existing Copyright Act. MinLaw and IPOS have considered all suggestions received and, where appropriate, incorporated the feedback into the Copyright Bill tabled for First Reading in Parliament on 6 July 2021.

3.	A summary of the key changes made in response to the feedback received can be found [here](/files/news/public-consultations/2021/copyrightbill/CopyrightBill_ClosingReport.pdf).
