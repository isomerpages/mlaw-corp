<li>
<p>MinLaw is seeking feedback on a proposed Guide for Using Generative AI
(“<strong>GenAI</strong>”) in the Legal Sector (the “<strong>Guide</strong>”).</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Guide sets out key principles and provides practical guidance to support
the responsible, ethical, and effective use of GenAI tools in Singapore’s
legal sector, while maintaining high standards of professional conduct.
The proposed Guide can be accessed <strong><a href="/files/Guide_for_Using_Generative_AI_in_the_Legal_Sector.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a></strong>.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The public consultation period is from <strong><u>1 September 2025 to 30 September 2025</u></strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This consultation is part of MinLaw’s ongoing efforts to support the transformation
and digitalisation of the legal sector. This effort complements MinLaw's
other legaltech initiatives, such as the Productivity Solutions Grant for
the Legal Sector (PSG-Legal) and the Legal Innovation and Future-Readiness
Transformation (LIFT) pilot initiative, which we launched in June 2025
to support law firms in their digitalisation efforts.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GenAI presents significant opportunities for legal professionals to enhance
productivity and service delivery, offering new approaches to traditional
workflows and service delivery models. However, many legal professionals
have expressed uncertainty about adopting GenAI due to concerns over hallucinations,
client confidentiality, and the lack of technical expertise to implement
and manage associated risks.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To support the legal sector in harnessing opportunities while navigating
the challenges associated with using GenAI technology, MinLaw has developed
the Guide to empower legal professionals to be informed buyers and users
of GenAI tools, while being mindful of professional obligations in the
delivery of legal services.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Overview of the Guide</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Guide provides examples of AI (including GenAI) applications that
can enhance legal work at different stages of the legal matter lifecycle
across practice areas. It outlines the associated implementation considerations
and practical safeguards for adoption.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Guide sets out <strong>three key principles</strong> that legal professionals
must observe when using GenAI in legal work:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Professional ethics:</strong> Legal professionals remain ultimately
responsible for all work product, and must apply the requisite knowledge,
skill and experience to provide competent advice and representation;</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure
client confidentiality is protected when procuring and using GenAI tools;
and</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> Consider disclosure to clients regarding
GenAI use, to uphold the duty of honesty and inform them of all information
that may reasonably affect their interests.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These principles reference the duties under the Legal Profession Act 1966
and the Professional Conduct Rules 2015. The Guide provides practical guidance
on maintaining compliance with legal professional duties when using GenAI,
supported by case studies from law practices demonstrating how these principles
can be applied. Legal professionals should consider these principles holistically,
and apply them to their specific context and operational requirements.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Guide provides step-by-step practical guidance on how to (a) develop
an AI adoption framework, (b) diagnose and analyse needs, (c) identify
and evaluate GenAI tools, (d) implement and train said tools, and (e) conduct
review and improvement processes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Guide was developed in consultation with key legal industry stakeholders
including the Singapore Academy of Law, Law Society of Singapore, and Singapore
Corporate Counsel Association. They also incorporate practical insights
from law practices that have successfully implemented GenAI in their practice.</p>
<p></p>
