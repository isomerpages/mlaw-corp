Responses to Feedback received from Public Consultation on the Proposed Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Regulatory Regime for Precious Stones and Metals Dealers
---

**Consultation Period:**  
13 Sep 2018 to 12 Oct 2018

1. The Ministry of Law held a public consultation on the proposed anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulatory regime for precious stones and metals dealers (PSMD). We received submissions from various sources, including industry associations, PSMDs, financial institutions, and other stakeholders including lawyers, compliance firms and the general public, on how the regime could be further refined.

2. We would like to thank all respondents for their feedback. The Ministry of Law has carefully considered all the feedback and suggestions received, and will incorporate them in the proposed regime where appropriate. A summary of responses to key feedback is enclosed at  **[Annex A](/files/AMLCFT_PSMD_Public_Consult_Response.pdf/){:target="_blank"}**.
