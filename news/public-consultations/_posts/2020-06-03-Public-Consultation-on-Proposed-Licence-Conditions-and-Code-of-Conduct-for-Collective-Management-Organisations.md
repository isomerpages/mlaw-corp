**Public Consultation on Proposed Licence Conditions and Code of Conduct for Collective Management Organisations**
---

**Consultation Period:**  
3 June 2020 to 14 July 2020

**Review of Collective Rights Management in Singapore**

Copyright is a form of intellectual property right which gives creators and producers of creative works the right to prevent or allow other people to use their creative works in certain ways, for a limited period of time.

Good copyright regimes balance between providing exclusive rights to creators as an incentive to create and disseminate new creative works, while providing appropriate access to those works for the benefit of other creators and for society. To do so, they must ensure that the rights they provide are reasonable, clear, and efficiently transacted.

In order to ensure that rights are efficiently transacted, MinLaw and IPOS are reviewing the collective rights management ecosystem in Singapore. Good collective rights management ecosystems make it easier for users to obtain permission to use copyrighted works, while channeling fees and revenues back to creators — to the benefit of everyone.

**Public Consultation on Proposed Licence Conditions and Code of Conduct for Collective Management Organisations**

MinLaw and IPOS are seeking feedback on a proposed licensing scheme for Collective Management Organisations (CMOs) in Singapore. This follows on from the responses received during the [Copyright Collective Rights Management Ecosystem Public Consultation 2017](/files/Copyright-Review-CMO-Consultation-Paper.pdf), and elaborates on the “light-touch” regulatory approach laid out in the [Copyright Review Report in 2019](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/files/news/press-releases/2019/01/Annex%20A%20-%20Copyright%20Review%20Report%2016%20Jan%202019.pdf). Your views are important and will help shape the outcome of this review. The consultation period will run from **<u>Wednesday 3 June to Tuesday 30 June 2020</u>**.

Following feedback from the public, the consultation exercise will be extended by two weeks. It will now close on **Wednesday 14 July 2020** instead. We invite all interested parties to provide responses by then.
