MinLaw and IPOS are conducting public consultation on the copyright collective rights management ecosystem in Singapore from <b><u>16 May 2017 to 23 June 2017</u></b>.

This public consultation is part of a broader overall review of Singapore’s copyright regime. A more general public consultation was held from August to November 2016. The responses to these public consultations will be taken into consideration in our review.

We invite all interested persons to provide feedback and suggestions on the questions and issues highlighted in this consultation paper. Respondents are also welcome to surface any other related issues.

The full public consultation paper may be viewed [here](/files/Copyright-Review-CMO_Consultation-Paper.pdf/).

Alternatively, if you prefer to provide detailed comments in writing, instructions for doing so may be found in <b><u>Part VI</u></b> of the full consultation paper (link above).

Following requests from the public, the consultation exercise will be extended by one week. It will now close on **Friday 23 June** instead. We invite all interested parties to provide responses by then.
