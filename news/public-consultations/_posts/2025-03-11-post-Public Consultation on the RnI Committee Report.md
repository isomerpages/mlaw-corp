The Committee to Enhance Singapore’s Corporate Restructuring and Insolvency Regime (the “**Committee**”) has on 11 March 2025 published its report (the “**Report**”), detailing its views, perspectives and recommendations on proposed amendments to further enhance Singapore's corporate debt restructuring and insolvency (“**R&I**”) framework.

3.  Singapore’s R&I framework has undergone significant transformation in the last decade. These reforms modernised Singapore’s R&I regime. Its increasing use, in particular with successful restructurings, supports Singapore’s broader economy and position as an international centre for business, finance, and law.

4.  The R&I framework was last amended in 2018 and it was considered timely to conduct a review to assess the same. In this context, the Committee was tasked to consider measures to further enhance Singapore’s R&I framework, and to attract even more international users to utilise this regime. The Committee was constituted by representatives drawn from across the corporate R&I ecosystem in legal, banking and finance industries with domestic and international practices, as well as academia, and members of the Government.

5.  The Committee has made a total of 9 recommendations, which fall into four broad categories:

* Strengthening the judicial management regime;
* Refining the cross-class cramdown in schemes of arrangements;
* Refining the framework and tools for efficient debt restructurings; and
* Adopting the UNCITRAL Model Law on Enterprise Group Insolvency and the UNCITRAL Model Law on Recognition and Enforcement of Insolvency-Related Judgments.
