Responses to Feedback Received from Public Consultation on the Proposed Amendments to the Patents (Patent Agents) Rules
---

**Consultation Period:**  
25 Nov 2013 to 20 Dec 2013

The Ministry of Law held a public consultation on the proposed amendments to the Patents (Patent Agents) Rules.  We received submissions from various sources, including industry associations, on how the legislation could be further refined.

We would like to thank all respondents for their feedback.  The Ministry of Law has carefully considered all the suggestions received, and will be incorporating some of the suggestions into the Patents (Patent Agents) (Amendment) Rules.  Our consolidated responses to the feedback received are provided in [ANNEX A](#).
