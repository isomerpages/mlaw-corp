<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee to Review the Regulatory Framework
for Law Practices and Collaborations in Singapore (the “<strong>Committee</strong>”)
has published its report (the “<strong>Report</strong>”) detailing its
views, perspectives and recommendations to further enhance Singapore’s
regulatory framework for law practices and collaborations between them.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ministry of Law welcomes the Report and will
be carefully reviewing the recommendations. To assist with this review,
the Ministry will be conducting an 8-week public consultation on the Committee’s
recommendations that will run from 16 October 2025 to 10 December 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore’s Legal Services Sector</strong>
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore’s legal services sector has achieved significant
growth by positioning itself to capitalise on globalisation driving cross-border
exchange of goods and services. This growth reflects greater demand for
high-end legal services to support our banking, financial and other economic
sectors. Asia is the world’s largest economic and trading region, responsible
for more than half of the world’s GDP growth. The need for legal services
will only continue to rise. The Singapore legal services sector must continue
to keep pace.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1999, the Singapore government has introduced
various policy initiatives and legislative changes to facilitate the entry
of foreign law practices and foreign lawyers into the Singapore market.
This has enhanced the diversity of Singapore’s legal service offerings
and established Singapore as an international legal services hub.</p>
<p><strong>The Committee</strong>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The regulatory framework for the legal services sector
was last reviewed in 2014. It is timely to conduct a review to evaluate
the efficacy of the current regulatory framework. The Committee was given
the following terms of reference:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Review
the extent to which the current regulatory framework for law practices
in Singapore and collaborations among them has met its original objectives;
and</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recommend
any changes to the regulatory framework, taking into account developments
and trends in legal services and the future needs of Singapore.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Committee has made a total of 10 recommendations,
which fall into four broad areas:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criteria
to enter into collaboration arrangements;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Requirements
for foreign law practice entities and foreign-qualified lawyers to hold
interests in Singapore law practices;</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lawyer
composition in foreign law practice entities; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permitted
areas of legal practice for licensed foreign law practices.</p>
