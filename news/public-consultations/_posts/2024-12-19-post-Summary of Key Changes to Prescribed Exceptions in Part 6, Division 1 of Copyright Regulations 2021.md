The Ministry of Law (“MinLaw”) and Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (“IPOS”) held a public consultation to seek feedback on prescribed exceptions allowing users to circumvent access control measures for non-infringing uses. This took place from 22 April 2024 to 2 June 2024. 

We received a total of 19 responses, with representation from rights owners and users, as well as Government agencies. We have reviewed and assessed all the feedback provided. A summary of the key changes to the prescribed exceptions subsidiary legislation is appended at the end of the page. The original public consultation paper is also available, as Annex A. 

MinLaw and IPOS would like to thank all respondents for their feedback.
