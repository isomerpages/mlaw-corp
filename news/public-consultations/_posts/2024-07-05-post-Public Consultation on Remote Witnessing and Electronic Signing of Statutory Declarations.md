<h2>Public Consultation on Remote Witnessing and Electronic Signing of Statutory Declarations</h2>
<p><strong>Consultation Period</strong>: 5 July 2024 to 2 August 2024
<br>
<br>1. The Ministry of Law is seeking feedback on the framework for remote
witnessing and electronic signing of statutory declarations.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>2. A statutory declaration is a written statement that a person signs,
and solemnly declares to be true. It has to be made before an authorised
service provider, such as a Commissioner for Oaths. This is an in-person,
paper-based process and usually involves the use of wet-ink signatures.</p>
<p>3. On 2 August 2023, Parliament passed the Oaths, Declarations and Notarisations
(Remote Methods) Act 2023 (“ODN Act”). The ODN Act amends the Oaths and
Declarations Act 2000. Once the ODN Act comes into force, it will, amongst
other things, provide individuals, businesses and service providers who
are executing statutory declarations with the option of remote witnessing
in place of an in-person meeting, and electronic signing in place of wet-ink
signing, as long as both the declarant and service provider are physically
present in Singapore.</p>
<p>4. We seek the public’s feedback on the specific requirements that should
govern the remote witnessing and electronic signing process for the execution
of statutory declarations. These requirements will be set out in subsidiary
legislation.</p>
