**PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON PRESCRIBED EXCEPTIONS IN PART 6, DIVISION 1 OF THE COPYRIGHT REGULATIONS 2021**
---

**Consultation Period:  
22 April 2024 to 19 May 2024**

MinLaw and IPOS are seeking comments on situations in which users should be permitted to circumvent technological measures that control access to copyright works or protected performances (“access control measures”).


**Background**

Access control measures are technologies, devices, or components that are akin to digital locks; in the normal course of their operation, they effectively control access to copyright works and protected performances. Though the Copyright Act 2021 (“CA”) prohibits the circumvention of these access control measures, in limited situations, the CA also provides exceptions where users can circumvent them for legitimate uses. Some exceptions require regular reviews, and this set of exceptions is the focus of the public consultation.
