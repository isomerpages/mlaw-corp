**Consultation Period**: 21 March to 2 May 2025

{:start="1"}
1. The Ministry of Law is seeking feedback on Singapore’s international arbitration regime and the International Arbitration Act 1994 (“**IAA**”). 

**Background**

{:start="2"}
2.  This year marks the 30th anniversary of the IAA which came into force on 1 January 1995, pursuant to which Singapore adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (1985) (“**Model Law**”) to provide a legal framework for international arbitration proceedings.

{:start="3"}
3.  As part of our continual review to ensure that Singapore remains attractive as an arbitration forum, MinLaw commissioned the Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (“**SIDRA**”) to conduct a study on the international arbitration regime in Singapore and the IAA.

{:start="4"}
4.  To assist in our assessment of SIDRA’s study and feedback received from various stakeholders, we invite members of the public to provide views on SIDRA’s report, with a focus on the following eight (8) issues:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(a) Whether to confer the power to make cost orders for arbitral proceedings following a successful setting aside of an award on the court;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(b) Whether separate cost principles should be applied in respect of unsuccessful setting aside applications;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(c) Whether to introduce a leave requirement for appeals to the Court of Appeal arising from a High Court decision in a setting aside application;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(d) Whether the time limit to file a setting aside application should be reduced;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(e) Whether a right of appeal on questions of law is desirable;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(f) How to ascertain the governing law of the arbitration agreement;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
(g) Whether the review of the tribunal’s jurisdiction should be conducted by way of an appeal or a rehearing; and</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
