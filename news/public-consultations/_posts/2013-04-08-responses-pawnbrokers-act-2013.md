Responses to feedback received from Public Consultation on the Proposed Amendments to the Pawnbrokers Act
---

**Consultation Period:**  
8 Apr 2013 to 6 May 2013

1. The Ministry of Law held a public consultation from 8 April 2013 to 6 May 2013 on the proposed amendments to the Pawnbrokers Act. We received submissions from various sources including our stakeholders and members of the industry. These submissions were in general supportive of the amendments and provided suggestions on how the legislation could be further fine-tuned.


2  We thank all respondents for their feedback. The Ministry of Law has considered these suggestions in detail and will be incorporating some of the feedback into the Bill.
