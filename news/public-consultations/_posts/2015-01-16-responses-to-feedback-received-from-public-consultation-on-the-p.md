Responses to feedback received from Public Consultation on the Proposed Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act
---

**Consultation Period:**  
16 Jan 2015 to 24 Feb 2015

1. The Ministry of Law held a public consultation on the proposed amendments to the Bankruptcy Act.  We received submissions from various sources, such as financial institutions, accountants, lawyers and the general public, on how the legislation could be further refined.

2. We would like to thank all respondents for their feedback.  The Ministry of Law has carefully considered all the suggestions received, and will be incorporating some of the suggestions into the Bankruptcy Act.  Our consolidated responses to the feedback received are provided in **[ANNEX A](/files/Bankruptcy_Bill-Govt_Response.pdf){:target="_blank"}(238KB)**.
