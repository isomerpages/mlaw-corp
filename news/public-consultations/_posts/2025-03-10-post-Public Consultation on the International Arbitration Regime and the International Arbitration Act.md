<h2>Public Consultation on the International Arbitration Regime and the International Arbitration Act</h2>
<p><strong>Consultation Period</strong>: [17 March 2025 to 28 April 2025]</p>
<p>1. The Ministry of Law is seeking feedback on Singapore's international
arbitration regime and the International Arbitration Act 1994 ("IAA").</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
</p>
<p>2. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the IAA coming into force on
1 January 1995, where Singapore adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration (1985) (“Model Law”) to provide a legal framework
for international arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p>3. As part of our continual review to ensure that Singapore remains attractive
as an arbitration forum, MinLaw commissioned the Singapore International
Dispute Resolution Academy (“SIDRA”) to conduct a study on the international
arbitration regime in Singapore and the IAA.</p>
<p>4. To assist in our assessment of SIDRA’s study, we invite members of
the public to provide views on SIDRA’s report, with a focus on the following
eight (8) issues:</p>
<p>a. Issue 1: Whether to confer the power to make cost orders for arbitral
proceedings following a successful setting aside of an award on the court;</p>
<p>b. Issue 2: Whether separate cost principles should be applied in respect
of unsuccessful setting aside applications;</p>
<p>c. Issue 3: Whether to introduce a leave requirement for appeals to the
Court of Appeal arising from a High Court decision in a setting aside application;</p>
<p>d. Issue 4: Whether the time limit to file a setting aside application
should be reduced;</p>
<p>e. Issue 5: Whether a right of appeal on questions of law is desirable;</p>
<p>f. Issue 6: How to ascertain the governing law of the arbitration agreement;</p>
<p>g. Issue 7: Whether the review of the tribunal’s jurisdiction should be
conducted by way of an appeal or a rehearing; and</p>
<p>h. Issue 8: Whether the summary disposal powers of arbitral tribunals
should be set out in the IAA.</p>
