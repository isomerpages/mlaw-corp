**Consultation Period:**  
7 Apr 2014 to 21 Apr 2014


1. The Ministry of Law held a public consultation on the proposed amendments to the Copyright Act.

2. We would like to thank all respondents for their feedback.  The Ministry of Law has carefully considered all the suggestions received, and will be incorporating some of the suggestions into the Copyright Act.  Our consolidated responses to the feedback received are provided in  [ANNEX A (0.31MB)](/files/news/public-consultations/2014/04/MinLaw Responses to feedback on Amendments to the Copyright Act .pdf).
