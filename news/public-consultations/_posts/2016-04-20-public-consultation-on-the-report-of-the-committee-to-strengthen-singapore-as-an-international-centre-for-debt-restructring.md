**Strengthening Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring**

3. Global corporate defaults have hit their highest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis. Regional law firms have reported a significant increase in insolvency and debt restructuring work. The Committee observes that Singapore has been able to coordinate significant regional restructuring cases because it is a major financial, legal and business hub. It provides businesses a convenient base combining efficiency, expertise and a clear and certain legal framework, from which to coordinate a multi-jurisdictional restructuring.

4. To further strengthen Singapore’s effectiveness as an international debt restructuring centre, the Committee has made 17 recommendations in three areas: first, enhancing the legal framework for restructurings; second, creating a restructuring friendly ecosystem; and third, addressing the perception gap.

5. To enhance the legal framework for restructurings, the Committee’s recommendations include:

<ol class="list-style-type:lower-roman">
 <li><b>Creating bespoke rules and procedures for restructuring</b>, to ensure that Singapore’s legal framework can resolve
  restructurings quickly and cost-efficiently, and delivers high certainty of outcomes.</li>
 <li>Deepening the bench with specialist insolvency judges**, who will take an active case management approach to assist in
  steering stakeholders to successful outcomes; and</li>
 <li>Increasing the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution processes** such as mediation or arbitration to resolve insolvency
  issues where appropriate, as they can result in significant cost savings.</li>
</ol>
 
{:start="6"}

6. To create a restructuring friendly ecosystem, the Committee’s recommendations include:
<ol class="list-style-type:lower-roman">
 <li><b>Increasing the availability of rescue financing</b>, to allow the debtor to continue its business operations as the restructuring is being negotiated; and</li>
 <li><b>Strengthening the quality of insolvency professionals based in Singapore</b>, to deepen expertise in handling complex cross-border restructuring work.</li>
</ol>

7. To address the perception gap, the Committee’s recommendations include:

<ol class="list-style-type:lower-roman">
 <li>Raising Singapore’s profile on the international stage**, through Singapore-based professionals, judges and academics
