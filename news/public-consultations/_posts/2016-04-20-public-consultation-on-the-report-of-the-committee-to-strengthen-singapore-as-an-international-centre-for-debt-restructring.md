**Strengthening Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring**

3. Global corporate defaults have hit their highest levels since the 2008 global financial crisis. Regional law firms have reported a significant increase in insolvency and debt restructuring work. The Committee observes that Singapore has been able to coordinate significant regional restructuring cases because it is a major financial, legal and business hub. It provides businesses a convenient base combining efficiency, expertise and a clear and certain legal framework, from which to coordinate a multi-jurisdictional restructuring.

4. To further strengthen Singapore’s effectiveness as an international debt restructuring centre, the Committee has made 17 recommendations in three areas: first, enhancing the legal framework for restructurings; second, creating a restructuring friendly ecosystem; and third, addressing the perception gap.

5. To enhance the legal framework for restructurings, the Committee’s recommendations include:
    * **Creating bespoke rules and procedures for restructuring**, to ensure that Singapore’s legal framework can resolve restructurings quickly and cost-efficiently, and delivers high certainty of outcomes.
    * **Deepening the bench with specialist insolvency judges**, who will take an active case management approach to assist in steering stakeholders to successful outcomes; and
    * **Increasing the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution processes** such as mediation or arbitration to resolve insolvency issues where appropriate, as they can result in significant cost savings.

6. To create a restructuring friendly ecosystem, the Committee’s recommendations include:
    * **Increasing the availability of rescue financing**, to allow the debtor to continue its business operations as the restructuring is being negotiated; and
    * **Strengthening the quality of insolvency professionals based in Singapore**, to deepen expertise in handling complex cross-border restructuring work.

7. To address the perception gap, the Committee’s recommendations include:
    * **Raising Singapore’s profile on the international stage**, through Singapore-based professionals, judges and academics increasing their involvement in international insolvency organisations, organising or speaking at conferences, and/or conducting research on cutting edge issues in this field.
