Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee met with the Vice Minister of Justice of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Dr Dinh Trung Tung who was in Singapore on a study visit from 12 to 16 June 2008. During the meeting, both sides reaffirmed the close ties between the two countries, and exchanged views on how to enhance bilateral cooperation.

Dr Dinh, who led a nine-member delegation, was also briefed on the roles and functions played by the Ministry of Law, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre and the Singapore Mediation Centre in shaping the legal and alternative dispute resolution industry in Singapore.

The delegation's visit comes in the wake of the Singapore-Vietnam MOU signing on legal and judicial cooperation. Both countries will work towards enhancing greater understanding of each country's laws, legal systems and legal institutions.
