The Ministry of Law has engaged Ernst & Young Advisory Pte. Ltd. (EY) to do a study on our customers’ experiences with our services. EY has been authorised to conduct a survey and focus group discussions for Ministry of Law to better understand our customers’ experiences so we can look into the possible areas to enhance the overall customer’s experiences.
 
Selected customers will be hearing from one of the Ministry’s appointed representatives from EY on the survey and focus group discussions from 23 May to 31 August 2018. All responses will be anonymised and kept strictly confidential.
