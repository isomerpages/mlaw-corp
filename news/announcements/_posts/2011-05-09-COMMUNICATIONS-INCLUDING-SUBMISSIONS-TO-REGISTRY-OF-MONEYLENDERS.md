With effect from 16th May 2011, all communications sent to the Registry of Moneylenders should be sent to the generic **IPTO ROMP** ( <ipto_romp@ipto.gov.sg> ) account and **<u>not</u>** to the email accounts of individual ROMP staff. This is to ensure that your queries are being attended to, as we have some recent staff movement. The submission of your quarterly returns should be sent to our new generic account **IPTO ROMPRETURNS** ( <ipto_rompreturns@ipto.gov.sg> ) with immediate effect.
