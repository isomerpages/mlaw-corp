1. The Ministry of Law held a public consultation from 27 July to 17 August 2009 on the International Arbitration (Amendment) Bill. We received submissions from lawyers, academics and industry experts. These submissions were in general supportive of the amendments and provided suggestions on how the legislation could be further fine-tuned.


2. We thank all respondents for their feedback. The Ministry of Law considered these suggestions in detail and incorporated some of the feedback into the Bill and its accompanying Explanatory Statement.
