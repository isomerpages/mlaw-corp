<ol>
<li> Given the COVID-19 situation and elevated safe distancing measures, management corporations (<b>"MCs"</b>) and collective sale committees (<b>"CSCs"</b>) have difficulties holding general meetings for en bloc sales and meetings of CSCs in the manner prescribed within the Land Titles (Strata) Act (<b>"LTSA"</b>).</li>

<li> The COVID-19 (Alternative Arrangements for Meetings for Management Corporations, Subsidiary Management Corporations and Collective Sale Committees) Order 2020 (<b>"Order"</b>) prescribes how such meetings may be conducted partially or wholly by electronic means, during the period from 27 March 2020 up to and including 30 September 2020 (<b>"Relevant Period"</b>).</li>

<li> Meetings convened and conducted in accordance with the Order during the Relevant Period are deemed to satisfy the requirements relating to the general meetings for en bloc sales and meetings of CSCs under the LTSA.</li>

<li> MCs and CSCs which decide to conduct such meetings in accordance with the Order during the Relevant Period may wish to refer to the guidance in the <u>Annex</u>. MCs which receive a relevant requisition for an en bloc sale during the Relevant Period may defer the corresponding general meeting beyond the statutory due date, if necessary. However, deferrals are not permitted under the Order after 30
September 2020.</li>
