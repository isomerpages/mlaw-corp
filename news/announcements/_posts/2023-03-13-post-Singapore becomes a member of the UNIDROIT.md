2. Founded in 1926 as part of the League of Nations, UNIDROIT is one of the world’s main organisations tasked with the development of international treaties and modern standards in private law, with special relevance in the areas of secured transactions, contract law, capital markets, digital economy, banking law, and agriculture.

3. To date, 127 States have benefited from UNIDROIT’s instruments. This includes Singapore, which is a Party to two instruments adopted under the auspices of UNIDROIT – the 2001 Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment and its 2001 Protocol on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment.
