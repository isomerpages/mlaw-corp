1. Government announced on 17 August 2006, its in-principle acceptance of the recommendation of the Third Committee on the Supply of Lawyers chaired by the former Attorney-General, to allow Singaporean citizens or Permanent Residents ("PRs") who graduated from Overseas Scheduled Universities with Second Class (Lower Division) Honours to practise law in Singapore, provided they possessed certain relevant work experience or qualifications.

2. The Ministry of Law and the Board of Legal Education (the "Board") are pleased to announce the details of the scheme. Candidates from recognized United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and US universities fulfilling the criteria set out below, may be eligible to qualify for admission as an advocate and solicitor of the Singapore Supreme Court.
