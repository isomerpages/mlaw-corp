1. Singapore will be the first Asian country to host a diplomatic conference in the field of intellectual property (IP), when IP policy makers from all member states of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) meet to negotiate a key international treaty in the field of trademarks next year.
 
2. The Diplomatic Conference for the Adoption of a Revised Trademark Law Treaty, organised by WIPO, will be held from March 13 to 31, 2006 at the Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre. The Conference is expected to bring together some 650 top IP policy makers and government experts from 183 countries, the branded goods industry and the IP profession.
 
3. The aim of the Conference is to update the existing 1994 Trademark Law Treaty to bring it in line with the technological advances of the past decade and to simplify legal requirements for trademark licensing. The Revised Treaty will further streamline administrative procedures for trademark applicants and owners, and, as compared with the 1994 Trademark Law Treaty, will make provisions for electronic filing of trademark applications. The proposed revision of the Trademark Law Treaty will result in cheaper and more efficient trademark registration procedures at a global scale.
 
4. WIPO's General Assembly, which met at the Organization's Geneva headquarters from September 28 to October 5, 2005, unanimously supported Singapore's offer to host the Diplomatic Conference. In the past, WIPO's Diplomatic Conferences have been held in European cities such as Geneva, Bern, Paris, Hague and Madrid. Only two non-European cities, namely, Washington, D.C. and Nairobi have previously hosted a Diplomatic Conference in the field of IP. A Diplomatic Conference is convened by international law-makers for the conclusion of an international treaty.
 
5. Mr. Ernesto Rubio, WIPO Assistant Director General, who oversees WIPO's work relating to trademarks said, "We are honoured by Singapore's generous offer to host this important meeting. This is a further reflection of Singapore's dedication and commitment to promoting IP for development and wealth creation."
 
6. Ms Liew Woon Yin, Director-General of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) said, "The convening of the Diplomatic Conference will be a key milestone in Singapore's journey to be a centre of excellence for IP development and business. It signals our commitment to contribute to the development of the international IP framework."
 
7. In recent years, Singapore has significantly upgraded its IP regime and supporting infrastructure. This has been an important factor in spurring the growth of knowledge intensive business activities. Local trademark applications have risen from some 21,000 in 2003 to more than 23,000 in 2004. IP-intensive companies are citing the well-established IP regime as a strong reason to locate in Singapore. More home-grown companies are investing in branding and venturing overseas. The local creative industries, such as the media and the arts sectors, are also showing strong promise.
