The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will be implementing an elevated set of safe distancing measures, as a circuit breaker to pre-empt the trend of increasing local transmission of COVID-19. This is to reduce movement and interactions in public and private places and for all to **leave home only for essential purposes**.

The measures will take effect from 7 April 2020 to 4 May 2020 (both dates inclusive).

The Ministry of Law’s services will continue to remain accessible to the public during this period, with digital and call services as the primary modes of work and service delivery. You are strongly encouraged to use our [e-services](http://www.mlaw.gov.sg/e-services) to access a range of services, including applying for legal aid from the Legal Aid Bureau (through the Applicant Portal), applying for public trustee services, and conducting transactions and applications at the various insolvency portals. Please click on the link for the full list of services available online. Instead of meeting face-to-face, our case officers will primarily contact you via telephone and email.

If you need assistance, for example with the use of our e-services or to defer your appointments, please call us at 1800 2255 529. Alternatively, you may submit an [enquiry form](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/enquiry/). Our case officers will be in touch with you within three to five working days.

During this period, please refrain from visiting the Ministry of Law Services Centre at Level 7 of the URA Centre (East Wing), to minimise your time spent in public spaces. You are also advised to defer non-urgent appointments until after 4 May 2020. If you already have appointments scheduled to meet our officers, we will contact you soon to reschedule the appointments.

**We seek your understanding and patience during this period as the counter service and call waiting times will be longer.** We also ask for your cooperation to comply with the heightened safe distancing measures in order to protect the health and well-being of yourself and all Singaporeans.
