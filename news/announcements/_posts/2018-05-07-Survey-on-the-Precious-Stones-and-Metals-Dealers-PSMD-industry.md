The Ministry of Law has commissioned QS First Pte Ltd to undertake a survey of the precious stones and metals dealers (PSMD) industry. The results of the survey will be crucial to the Ministryâ€™s assessment of the money-laundering and terrorism-financing risk, and will help the Ministry to design preventive measures that are suitable and proportionate to the level of risk.
 
PSMDs may be approached by surveyors from QS First Pte Ltd, based on random sampling, to complete the survey from April to June 2018. The surveyors will carry an identification badge provided by QS First Pte Ltd and a letter of authorisation from the Ministry of Law. All responses will be anonymised and kept strictly confidential
