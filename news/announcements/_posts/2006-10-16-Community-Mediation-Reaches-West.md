In conjunction with Racial Harmony Month, the Community Mediation Unit organised the 4th Community Mediation Roadshow at West Mall on Saturday, 10 Jul 2004.

The day's programme commenced with free give-aways and fringe activities, including silhouette cutting, Chinese calligraphy written on paper fans, balloon sculpting and even fresh popcorn! This was followed by stage performances, with children and adults captivated by the acrobatic acts of Big Ben, the Clown, Bosco, the Fire-Eater and Jeremy, the Magician.

Spirits heightened when the invited guests comprising representatives from MinLaw and the South West Community Development Council, joined Senior Minister of State for Law, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee and Mayor of South West District, Mrs Yu-Foo Yee Shoon in the opening ceremony on stage.

After the opening ceremony, a skit dubbed "Community Watch" was performed by a talented acting cast to convey the advantages of mediation. Through witty and light-hearted re-enactments, they demonstrated how the public could approach Community Mediation Centres (CMC) to resolve their conflicts.

More than 670 residents participated in the fringe activities. A survey was conducted with the audience to gauge the level of awareness on mediation and CMCs' services. The majority of respondents indicated that they were willing to try mediation if they had an unresolved dispute.

Children participated eagerly in stage games:
