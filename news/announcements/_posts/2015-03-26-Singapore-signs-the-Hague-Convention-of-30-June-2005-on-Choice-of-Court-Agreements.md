Singapore signed the Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements on 25 March 2015. Ms Thian Yee Sze, Director-General of the Ministry of Law’s Legal Group, signed the Convention on behalf of Singapore. Singapore joins the likes of the European Union, the United States and Mexico who have become party to, or signed the Convention. The signing marks a major step for Singapore to become party to the Convention.

The Convention helps to create a more conducive legal environment to international trade and investments. It does this by ensuring the effectiveness of exclusive choice of court agreements between parties to international commercial transactions and ensuring that judgments by the chosen court are recognised and enforced in Contracting States. Businesses engaging in cross-border activities will therefore have greater certainty on where disputes will be litigated and where judgments can be enforced. Specifically, the Convention will strengthen the enforceability of Singapore court judgments abroad. It will also promote the use of Singapore courts, with its reputation for being efficient, effective and a neutral jurisdiction, in international commercial disputes. 

Singapore has been a member of the [Hague Conference on Private International Law](/news/announcements/singapore-member-of-hague-conference-on-pte-intl-law) since 2014. Singapore is party to two conventions under the Hague Conference – the International Child Abduction Convention and the Taking of Evidence Abroad Convention.
