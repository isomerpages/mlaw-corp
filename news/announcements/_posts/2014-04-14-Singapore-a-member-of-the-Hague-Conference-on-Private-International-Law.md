Singapore formally became a member of [the Hague Conference](http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php) on Private International Law on 9 April 2014.  Ms Thian Yee Sze, Director-General of the Ministry of Law’s Legal Group, deposited the instrument of acceptance on behalf of Singapore. The Ministry of Law will be Singapore’s National Organ and contact point with the Hague Conference.

Formed in 1893, the Hague Conference is a leading organisation in the field of private international law.   As part of its goal to enhance legal security, the Hague Conference has drawn up an impressive list of close to 40 international treaties and conventions aimed at building bridges between legal systems while respecting their diversity, thus increasing legal security for individuals and companies around the world. 

Singapore has long supported the work of the Hague Conference and is already party to two conventions under the Hague Conference – the International Child Abduction Convention and the Taking of Evidence Abroad Convention.  As a member of the Hague Conference, we look forward to taking our participation in the Hague Conference to a new level.
