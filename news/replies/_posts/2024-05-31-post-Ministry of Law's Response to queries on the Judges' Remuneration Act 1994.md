{:start="1"} 1.&nbsp; In response to queries, the following statement is issued to make clarifications on the Judges’ Remuneration Act 1994.&nbsp;

<b>Clarification on the Act</b>

{:start="2"} 2.&nbsp; The Act does not allow a Minister to determine payments made to specific Supreme Court Judges. The insinuation that Ministers can influence the outcome of cases by controlling the salaries and benefits of Supreme Court judges is false.

{:start="3"} 3.&nbsp; This is not how the salaries and bonuses of Judges are determined, whether in law or in practice. Only the Chief Justice assesses the performance of the Supreme Court Judges under the salary framework established in accordance with the Act, ensuring that the process remains independent of ministerial influence.&nbsp; Any other suggestion is wrong and baseless speculation.

{:start="4"} 4.&nbsp; The Act, which was debated in Parliament as recently as 2019 when the Judges’ Remuneration (Amendment) Bill was passed, empowers the Minister to establish a framework for the remuneration of Supreme Court Judges as a class. It does not empower the Minister to influence or determine payments to specific Judges under this framework. In particular:

* Section 2(1) of the Act empowers the Minister to determine the annual pensionable salaries paid to Judges as a class.

* Section 2(2) of the Act empowers the Minister to create a framework for allowances and privileges for Judges that must be no less favourable than those provided to public officers.

{:start="5"} 5.&nbsp; As explained in Parliament on 10 January 2023<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, the framework determined under the Act is that the annual salary package of Supreme Court Judges consists of six components:

* &nbsp; Gross monthly salary,
* &nbsp; Annual Variable Component,
* &nbsp; Non-Pensionable Annual Allowance,
* &nbsp; Performance Bonus,
* &nbsp; National Bonus, and
* &nbsp; Judiciary Allowance.

{:start="6"} 6.&nbsp; Except for the Judiciary Allowance and the fixed components of the gross monthly salary, the other components may vary depending on economic conditions and individual performance.

{:start="7"} 7.&nbsp; The effect of economic conditions applies uniformly to Judges in their class. With regards to individual performance, it is the Chief Justice who assesses each Judge’s performance and determines the performance aspects of the components that are paid to each Judge.

{:start="8"} 8.&nbsp; Ministers therefore have no role whatsoever in the determination of discretionary performance payments for individual Supreme Court judges.&nbsp;
