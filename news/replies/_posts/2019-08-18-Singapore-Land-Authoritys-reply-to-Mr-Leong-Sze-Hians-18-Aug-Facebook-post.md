Dear Mr Leong,  

You have now alleged that you thought that the encroachment was from 1.3 cm to 4.9 cm, because the diagram sent to you showed no measurement scales.  


You are adding to the untruths that you have been putting out.  


We sent you a letter on 5 Feb 2018.  It enclosed a diagram (below). The diagram will show that you are telling untruths:

1. The total area of encroachment is clearly stated as 3.7 sq m.  You could not have thought that the encroachment was 1.3 cm/4.9 cm.

2. The width of the whole of your land is stated to be 12.68. On your logic, then you also assumed that the width of your land is 126.8 cm (1.268 m)? And your house was built on 126.8 cm (1.268 m) of land?

3. The diagram shows encroachment as being 0.13 to 0.49. In what metric system, does 0.13 equate to 1.3 cm? Or 0.49 equate to 4.9 cm?

We have been discussing this for 18 months. Your neighbours understand, and have been co-operative. Four have removed their encroachments completely, while the last remaining is taking steps to do so.

You seem to think that you are entitled to a different and special treatment. That is not possible.

**SINGAPORE LAND AUTHORITY**
