On 28 February 2018, the Ministry of Law tabled the Criminal Justice Reform Bill and the Evidence (Amendment) Bill in Parliament. The 52 proposed amendments arise from an end-to-end review of the criminal justice process, from investigation and court processes, to sentencing. These amendments are a major step in the Government's long-term efforts towards a more progressive, balanced and modern criminal justice system.
