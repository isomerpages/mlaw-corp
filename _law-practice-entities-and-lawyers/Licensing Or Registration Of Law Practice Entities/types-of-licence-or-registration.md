An FLA arrangement allows the member law practices to share office premises, resources and client information as well as co-brand and bill for permitted matters. However, the member law practices remain distinct entities and may only provide legal services that the respective law practices and their lawyers are allowed to provide under the Legal Profession Act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The FLA scheme was conceived as a means to facilitate cooperation between two or more independent law practice entities that are capable of dealing with each other as equal partners. The relevant legal framework for approval of these applications is interpreted and applied by the LSRA in this context.</p>
