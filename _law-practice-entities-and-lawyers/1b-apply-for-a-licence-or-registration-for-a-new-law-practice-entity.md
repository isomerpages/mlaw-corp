        <li>If you are applying for a licence for a new law practice entity because you are converting the legal structure of an existing law practice entity, please ensure that you also submit an application via LSRA e-Services to terminate the existing law practice entity.

Please note that the lawyers in your law practice will also need to submit a Notice of Change via eLitigation (for Singapore solicitors) or apply to LSRA for new Certificates of Registration (for Singapore solicitors in foreign law practice entities or foreign-qualified lawyers). After the termination application is approved, the Certificates of Registration of all individuals registered under the existing law practice will be automatically terminated on the last day of operations of the existing law practice</li>
