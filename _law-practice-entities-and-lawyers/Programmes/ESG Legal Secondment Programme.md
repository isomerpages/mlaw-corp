<p>The <strong>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Legal Secondment Programme (LSP)</strong> is
a secondment initiative by the Ministry of Law. <strong>It places Singapore-qualified lawyers into corporate sustainability teams, where they work on live ESG projects.</strong> Secondees
gain practical ESG experience, sharpen commercial acumen, and return ready
to strengthen their law firms’ ESG practice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong>
</p>
<p>Sustainability is no longer optional – it is transforming how companies
operate, invest, and report. Across the world, businesses face increasing
scrutiny from regulators, investors, and customers on their ESG performance.</p>
<p><strong>Singapore is positioning itself as a regional leader in sustainable finance, carbon markets, and green infrastructure.</strong> According
to PwC, <a href="https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/publications/sustainability-linked-opportunities-the-new-frontier-for-singapores-legal-sector.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sustainability-related legal work in Singapore is projected to grow from S$180M in 2023 to S$500M by 2033</a>.</p>
<p>For the legal sector, this represents a major growth opportunity. Law
firms with <strong>practical ESG expertise</strong> will be better positioned
to capture high-value mandates and advise clients with confidence.</p>
