**First Conveyancing Pilot Trial (April 2010 to August 2010)**

The Ministry of Law successfully conducted a first pilot trial from April to August 2010 with almost 50 law firms, the Law Society, banks, the Singapore Academy of Law, CPF Board, and HDB, to test and refine workflows associated with conveyancing under a set of proposed measures to safeguard conveyancing money.

The list of participating banks, law firms, and partner agencies for the First Conveyancing Pilot Trial (April to August 2010) can be found here.

**Second Conveyancing Pilot Trial (November 2010 to February 2011)**

To ensure that the conveyancing workflows that accompany the proposed measures will work well in practice, MinLaw has conducted a second pilot trial with more than 100 law firms, CPFB, HDB, SAL and three pilot banks (DBS, UOB and OCBC) to test further out these conveyancing workflows. This second pilot trial enabled MinLaw to track the progress of each pilot case and receive feedback on both the manual and newly-developed electronic workflows, and to refine them before implementation. The second pilot trial ran from November 2010 to February 2011.
