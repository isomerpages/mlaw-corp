In land scarce Singapore, optimising the use of land resources is integral to sustaining Singapore’s economic and social growth.  

MinLaw formulates and reviews the following policies to support the optimal use of land resources:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Residential Property Act</b>
    <ul class="hide">
      <li>The <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/RPA1976" target="_blank">Residential Property Act (RPA)</a> strikes a balance between ensuring that the limited supply of landed residential properties in Singapore remains the primary preserve of Singapore Citizens, whilst allowing selected foreigners who have demonstrated social commitment and are making a significant economic contribution to Singapore to also own landed homes. Foreigners who wish to purchase landed residential properties have to submit an application to the Land Dealings Approval Unit at the <a href="https://www.sla.gov.sg/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Singapore Land Authority (SLA)</a>.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Land Acquisition Act</b>
    <ul class="hide">
      <li>The <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/LAA1966?TransactionDate=19920325235959" target="_blank">Land Acquisition Act (LAA)</a> is a key legislation that enables the compulsory acquisition of private land for public purposes, such as the building of transportation infrastructure and public housing. Landowners whose lands are acquired are paid market value compensation under the LAA.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Land Titles (Strata) Act</b>
    <ul class="hide">
      <li>The sale of private strata developments in en bloc sales, or collective sales, facilitates redevelopment and supports urban rejuvenation.

MinLaw is also the guardian of State land.  Its Statutory Board, the [Singapore Land Authority (SLA)](https://www.sla.gov.sg/Home.aspx){:target="_blank"}, manages approximately 11,000 hectares of State land and 5,000 State buildings.

SLA provides the following land administration services:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Selling and leasing land to the public and private sector, and allocating land to support national development</b>
    <ul class="hide">
      <li>The SLA facilitates the sale and leasing of State land to both the public and private sectors for various uses, such as public housing, industrial development, community uses.  The integrity of the land allocation and administration process is critical to meet ever-changing socio-economic needs, and to maintain confidence in land transactions. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Registration of land and property transactions and the issuance and guarantee of land titles in Singapore</b>
    <ul class="hide">
      <li>Land rights are of vital social and economic importance, because they form the basis on which many economic and business activities can take place.  The high level of home and property ownership in Singapore also necessitates a secure land titles registration system. Land titles records are maintained by the SLA, the national land registration authority for property transactions and the issuance and guarantee of land titles in Singapore.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Managing and collating digitised information on Singapore's roads and MRT networks, property boundaries, outlines of public housing and industrial buildings</b>
    <ul class="hide">
