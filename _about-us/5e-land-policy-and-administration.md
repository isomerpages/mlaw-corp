In land scarce Singapore, optimising the use of land resources is integral to sustaining Singaporeâ€™s economic and social growth.  

MinLaw formulates and reviews the following policies to support the optimal use of land resources:

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Residential Property Act</b>
    <ul class="no-style">
      <li>The <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/RPA1976" target="_blank">Residential Property Act (RPA)</a> strikes a balance between ensuring that the limited supply of landed residential properties in Singapore remains the primary preserve of Singapore Citizens, whilst allowing selected foreigners who have demonstrated social commitment and are making a significant economic contribution to Singapore to also own landed homes. Foreigners who wish to purchase landed residential properties have to submit an application to the Land Dealings Approval Unit at the <a href="https://www1.sla.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Singapore Land Authority (SLA)</a>.</li>

MinLaw is also the guardian of State land.  Its Statutory Board, the [Singapore Land Authority (SLA)](https://www.sla.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}, manages approximately 11,000 hectares of State land and 5,000 State buildings.
