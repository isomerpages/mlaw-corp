The Public Trustee administers the estates of deceased persons, where the value of the estate does not exceed $50,000, as well as compensation in motor accident cases. The Public Trustee also maintains a confidential Wills Registry which acts as a central information centre for all Wills that are drawn up, of which notice has been given to the Public Trustee.
