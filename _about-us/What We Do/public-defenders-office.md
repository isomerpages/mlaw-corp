The [Public Defender's Office](https://pdo.mlaw.gov.sg/) (PDO) is established to enhance access to justice to vulnerable persons through the provision of criminal defence aid. 

Set up as a department under the Ministry of Law, the PDO will be staffed by full-time officers who are responsible for assisting the Chief Public Defender in carrying out his functions under the Public Defenders Act 2022.

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who are charged with non-capital criminal offences or wish to file/defend an appeal but are unable to afford legal representation due to limited means, may apply for criminal defence aid with the PDO. All applicants must satisfy both the means and merits criteria, and may be required to make a contribution, before being assessed as eligible for criminal defence aid.
