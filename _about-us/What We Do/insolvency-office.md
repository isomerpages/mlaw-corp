The Official Assignee administers the affairs of bankrupts and the Official Receiver administers the affairs of wound-up companies. Both seek to recover assets from the insolvent to satisfy the debts owed to creditors while ensuring that the insolvent is treated fairly.

To promote enterprise and entrepreneurship, Singaporeâ€™s debt recovery system strikes a balance between meeting the interests of creditors and providing fresh starts for debtors.

There are also alternative schemes for financially-distressed individuals to repay their debts to creditors, and to avoid the social stigma attached to bankruptcy. For more information on the Insolvency Office, please click [here](https://io.mlaw.gov.sg/).
