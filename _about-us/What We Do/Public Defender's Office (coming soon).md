The Public Defender's Office (PDO) is established to enhance access to justice to vulnerable persons through the provision of criminal defence aid. 

Set up as a department under the Ministry of Law, the PDO will be staffed by full-time officers who are responsible for assisting the Chief Public Defender in carrying out his functions under the Public Defenders Act 2022.

With the establishment of the PDO, we will also expand income coverage up to the 35th percentile of households and widen offences to cover all criminal offences with specific exceptions. These exceptions include offences which are not punishable by death, regulatory offences, offences under 10 specific Acts that relate to gambling and betting, terrorism, organised and syndicated crime, and private prosecutions.
