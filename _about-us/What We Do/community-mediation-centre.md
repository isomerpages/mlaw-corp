<p>The Community Mediation Unit (CMU) promotes the resolution of community
disputes through mediation and it currently operates the <a href="https://cmc.mlaw.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Community Mediation Centres</a>{:target="_blank"}.</p>
<p>Mediation is carried out in private between disputants by specially trained
volunteers. They try to help disputants reach an amicable solution, and
where necessary, a written settlement that binds the parties.</p>
