<h1>Maintenance Enforcement Division</h1>
<p>The Maintenance Enforcement Division (MED) enhances access to justice
by improving the process for enforcing maintenance orders.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The MED is set up as a division under the Insolvency &amp; Public Trustee's
Office. An application to enforce maintenance arrears may be referred to
the Maintenance Enforcement Officers (MEOs), who will conduct conciliation
sessions between the two parties with a view to facilitating sustainable
solutions, conduct fact-finding on partiesâ€™ financial circumstances, refer
suitable parties to financial assistance, and submitting information to
the court.</p>
<p></p>
