The [Legal Aid Bureau](https://lab.mlaw.gov.sg/)(“LAB”) ensures equal access to justice to persons of limited means, by providing them legal aid, advice and assistance in civil matters. This includes representing applicants in many kinds of court proceedings, as set out in the Legal Aid and Advice Act. LAB cases are handled by LAB’s in-house lawyers and assigned solicitors. To qualify for legal aid, an applicant must satisfy both the Means and Merits tests.

LAB does not handle criminal proceedings. If you require legal representation in criminal proceedings, you may approach the Public Defender's Office which administers criminal defence aid.
