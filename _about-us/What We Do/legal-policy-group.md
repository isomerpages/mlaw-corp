MinLaw ensures a sound and progressive legal framework that is relevant and modern, provides access to justice, and upholds the rule of law.

The Legal Policy Group, comprising the Civil and Legislative Policy Division and the Criminal Policy Division, regularly reviews laws, proposes reforms, to civil, family, community-related and criminal related laws, and pursues new initiatives to strengthen the legal infrastructure. Under the Criminal Policy Division, The Criminology Unit conducts emprical criminalogy research.

Some of MinLaw’s recent law reform projects include the legislation [mandatory death penalty reforms](/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-on-the-proposed-amendments-to-the-penal-code-and-criminal-procedure-code){:target="_blank"}, amendments to the [Criminal Procedure Code 2010](/news/parliamentary-speeches/second-reading-speech-by-law-minister-k-shanmugam-on-the-criminal-procedure-code-bill){:target="_blank"}, and the [Civil Law Act](/news/parliamentary-speeches/second-reading-speech-by-minister-for-law-mr-k-shanmugam-on-the-civil-law-amendment-bill){:target="_blank"}. MinLaw has also introduced new measures to [safeguard conveyancing money](/about-us/what-we-do/conveyancing/).

MinLaw vets all Government Bills to ensure that they reflect sound legal policy principles and are consistent with Singapore’s Constitution. MinLaw also plays a pivotal role in inter-ministry efforts in public policy formulation, particularly where legal policy considerations have a dominant role, and in matters relating to international law.

MinLaw’s functions are distinct from the Judiciary, comprising the Supreme and State Courts, which adjudicate on matters brought before the Courts. MinLaw is also separate from AGC. The Attorney-General serves as the legal adviser to the Government and is also the Public Prosecutor.
