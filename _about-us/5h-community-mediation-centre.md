The Community Mediation Unit (CMU) promotes the resolution of community disputes through mediation and it currently operates the [Community Mediation Centres](https://cmc.mlaw.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"} throughout Singapore.

Mediation is carried out in private between disputants by specially trained volunteers. They try to help disputants reach an amicable solution, and where necessary, a written settlement that binds the parties.
