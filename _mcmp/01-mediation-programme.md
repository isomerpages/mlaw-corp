### MinLaw COVID-19 (Wedding) Mediation Programme ###

In response to the emergence of new virus variants and the resurgence of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce announced a Heightened Alert, and tightened safe management measures with effect from 8 May 2021 to minimise the transmission of the virus.

Most wedding couples and vendors have been able to come to a mutually acceptable resolution on their own (e.g. for the event to be postponed). For parties who require help reaching an agreement, the Ministry of Law is providing free mediation for wedding couples and vendors whose wedding events were/are scheduled to be held on a date between <b><u>8 May 2021 to 31 July 2021</u></b> (both dates inclusive).

Mediation under this programme is an informal and voluntary process. The mediation session is conducted virtually, and facilitated by a professionally trained mediator.

From 14 July 2021, interested parties can apply to the Ministry of Law for mediation by filling up the [Request for Mediation](https://www.go.gov.sg/request-for-mediation), and emailing it to both MinLaw and the other part(ies) to the contract. The Request for Mediation must be submitted by 10 September 2021.
