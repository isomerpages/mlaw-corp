### What is Mediation? ###

Mediation is a private dispute resolution process, where parties agree to refer their dispute to a neutral third party (i.e. the mediator). The mediator will assist parties to reach a mutually acceptable resolution.  

During mediation, the mediator will listen as parties explain the issues in conflict. Through joint or private sessions, the mediator will define the issues, clarify partiesâ€™ positions and interests, explore the available options, and guide parties towards coming up with their own solutions. 

The mediator is not an arbiter or an Assessor; he/she does not make any decision on behalf of the parties. It is for the parties to explore and settle on an amicable resolution, with the assistance of the mediator. 

A settlement agreement entered into by parties during the mediation is binding, and can subsequently be enforced in court.
