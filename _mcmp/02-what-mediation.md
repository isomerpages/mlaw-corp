### What is Mediation? ###

Mediation is a private dispute resolution process, where parties agree to refer their dispute to a neutral third party (i.e. the mediator). The mediator will assist parties to reach a mutually acceptable resolution.  

During mediation, the mediator will listen as parties explain the issues in conflict. Through joint or private sessions, the mediator will define the issues, clarify parties’ positions and interests, explore the available options, and guide parties towards coming up with their own solutions. 

The mediator is not an arbiter or an Assessor; he/she does not make any decision on behalf of the parties. It is for the parties to explore and settle on an amicable resolution, with the assistance of the mediator. 

A settlement agreement entered into by parties during the mediation is binding, and can subsequently be enforced in court.
