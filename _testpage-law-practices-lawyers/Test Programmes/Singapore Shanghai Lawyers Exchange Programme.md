the Singapore-Shanghai Lawyers Exchange Programme]</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>About the programme</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Singapore-Shanghai Lawyers Exchange Programme was introduced in 2023,
pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Singapore Ministry
of Law, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Justice, The Law Society of Singapore
and the Shanghai Bar Association.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The goal is to facilitate knowledge exchange, and promote understanding
of the business environment and culture between the two cities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two separate programmes:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two-month attachment, where Singapore-qualified lawyers are attached to
Chinese law firms in Shanghai for two months. Funding support is available.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One-week study visit, where Singapore lawyers will visit selected Shanghai
law firms, institutions, businesses and agencies, and engage with potential
clients and partners. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>China is the second largest economy in the world. and one of Singapore’s
most important trade and investment partners. As Singapore enterprises
expand their presence in China, and Chinese companies increasingly use
Singapore as a gateway into Southeast Asia and global markets, the scale
and sophistication of cross-border commercial activity is expected to grow.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this environment, lawyers on both sides must navigate not only different
legal systems, but also distinct regulatory frameworks, business cultures,
and professional practices. The Singapore–Shanghai Lawyers Exchange Programme
offers a structured and valuable platform for practitioners to gain first-hand
exposure to how law is practised in each jurisdiction, deepen their understanding
of local legal frameworks, and build trusted professional networks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through these exchanges, lawyers develop practical, on-the-ground insights
that strengthen their ability to advise clients on complex cross-border
matters, manage legal and commercial risk more effectively, and support
the continued growth of trade and investment between Singapore, China,
and beyond.</p>
