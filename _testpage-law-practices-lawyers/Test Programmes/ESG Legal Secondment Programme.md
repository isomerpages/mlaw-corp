<p>The <strong>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Legal Secondment Programme (LSP</strong>)
is a forward-looking initiative by the Ministry of Law to build ESG capabilities
within the legal sector.</p>
<p>The programme place<strong> </strong>Singapore-qualified lawyers<strong> </strong>into
corporate ESG teams to work on live ESG-related projects, fostering direct
collaboration between business and law<strong>.</strong> The programme provides
lawyers with first-hand ESG experience and gives host organisations access
to embedded legal talent. The goal is to cultivate a robust advisory ecosystem,
strengthening Singapore’s position as a leading sustainable legal business
hub.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>WHY IT MATTERS</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The global economy is being reshaped by new sustainability regulations
and evolving financial risks. In response, corporations are increasingly
integrating ESG into their strategies. However, the market for specialised
ESG legal services in Singapore is still in a formative stage.</p>
<p>This programme is a strategic intervention to bridge that gap. It addresses
the need for commercially-grounded legal expertise by allowing lawyers
to gain practical insights from within a corporate environment. This proactive
collaboration helps both businesses and their legal advisors prepare for
the complexities of the evolving ESG landscape.</p>
