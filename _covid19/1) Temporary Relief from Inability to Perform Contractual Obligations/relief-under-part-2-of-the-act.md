## Relief under Part 2 of the Act ##

Part 2 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act provided parties in certain categories of contracts temporary relief from legal and enforcement actions for a prescribed period, if they were unable to perform their contractual obligations due to COVID-19.

The Part 2 relief covered the period from 20 April 2020 to 28 February 2022 (the exact time frame depending on the category of the contract), and is no longer available.
