### Options to Purchase and Sale and Purchase Agreements with Developers ###

<a name="31Decnote"><u>Important Note</u></a>: The prescribed period for Options to Purchase and Sale and Purchase Agreements ended on 30 June 2021. The reliefs described on this page have expired.

#### General FAQs ####
<a name="q1">**1.	I am a buyer of a property (residential, commercial or industrial) from a developer and have difficulties with my obligations.  What reliefs under the Act are available to me?**</a>

* The developer cannot start or continue court or insolvency proceedings against you during the prescribed period (i.e. up to <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a>).  

* Additionally:

    *	<b>For OTPs</b>: The developer may not withhold or forfeit any part of the booking fee (or other consideration paid for the OTP) during the prescribed period (i.e. up to <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a>).

    *	<b>For S&P Agreements / Agreements for Leases (“AFLs”):</b>: The developer cannot terminate the S&P Agreement or AFL during the prescribed period (i.e. up to <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a>).
    
    * <b>For S&P Agreements / AFLs</b>: The late payment interest rate and charges that are chargeable on arrears that accrued between 1 February 2020 and <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a> will be capped at the amount equal to 5% per annum of simple interest on the arrears. In other words, you are not liable to pay any late payment interest or fees above that amount. This helps to reduce the growth of your debt when you are unable to pay due to the impact of COVID-19. See <a href="#q18">FAQs (15) – (25)</a> for more details. 

**2.	What conditions must I, the buyer, meet to enjoy the reliefs?**

<a name="q3">**3.	What must I, the buyer, do to enjoy the reliefs?**</a>

*	The reliefs under the Act <b>do not take effect automatically</b>.

*	If you qualify for the relief, you need to first serve a <b>Notification for Relief</b> on the developer, using the form at this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass) or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass).

*	Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the developer, it cannot take the above actions in <a href="#q1">FAQ(1)</a>.

#### Specific FAQs ####

<u>For buyers</u>

**4.	I cannot make the payment required upon exercising the OTP, or due under the S&P Agreement / AFL. Do I qualify for the relief?**

*	Relief will only apply if you can demonstrate that you are <b>unable to make the payments due, because of COVID-19</b>. This can occur in a variety of circumstances, including where you have lost your job as a result of COVID-19. 


**5.	I purchased the property together with another person. We now cannot meet the payment schedule as one of us has lost our job. Do we qualify for the relief?**

*	If you purchased the property together with another person, both your circumstances will need to be considered together to determine whether the reliefs apply. 


**6.	Does the Act cover OTPs / S&P Agreements / AFLs for resale HDB flats or private properties?**

*	The Act does <b>not</b> cover OTPs / S&P Agreements / AFLs between a buyer and a seller who is not a developer. 


**7.	Does the relief extend the Option Period of my OTP?**

*	The Act does not extend the option period of the OTP.

*	The option period may be extended by:

    *	Agreement between the buyer and seller (subject to the necessary regulatory approvals); or
    *	A determination by an Assessor.
 
**8.	My OTP expired, and my booking fee has already been forfeited. Does the Act apply?**

*	If the booking fee (or part thereof) has already been forfeited, the Act cannot help you get back that part of the booking fee.


**9.	My developer has already terminated my S&P Agreement / AFL. Does the Act apply?**

*	The Act does not apply to S&P Agreements / AFLs that have already been terminated. 


**10.	My OTP is about to expire. I still want to exercise it but cannot make the payment due because of COVID-19. What should I do to seek relief under the Act?**

* For residential, commercial and industrial properties (including HDB and Executive Condominiums)

   * You should serve the developer with a Notification for Relief, as explained further at <a href="#q3">FAQ(3)</a>. Once you have served a Notification for Relief, the developer will not be able to forfeit any part of your booking fee on or before 30 June 2021.

   * You should discuss with the developer to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
   * If you cannot reach an agreement with the developer, either party may make an application for an Assessor’s determination. Please click on this link for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.
   * The Assessor will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Depending on the circumstances, the Assessor may make a determination on how long the OTP should be extended, and the terms of such extension. The Assessor may also make a determination on whether the booking fee (or part thereof) should be refunded, should the purchase be aborted.

**11.	My OTP is about to expire. I cannot make the payment due because of COVID-19. I no longer want to exercise the option, and am afraid that I will lose all of my booking fee. What should I do to seek relief under the Act?**

*	First, you should serve the developer with a Notification for Relief, as explained further at <a href="#q3">FAQ(3)</a>. Once you have served a Notification for Relief, the developer will not be able to forfeit any part of your booking fee on or before <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a>. 

*	Next, you should discuss with the developer to reach a mutually acceptable solution on dealing with the booking fee. 

*	If you cannot reach an agreement with the developer, either party may make an application for an Assessor’s determination. Please click on this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.

*	The Assessor will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Depending on the circumstances, the Assessor may make a determination on whether the booking fee (or part thereof) should be refunded. 


**12.	I am unable to meet the payment schedule under the S&P Agreement / AFL because of COVID-19. Should I issue a Notification for Relief or apply for an Assessor’s determination?**

*	If you have been affected by COVID-19, and are unable to make the payments due under your S&P Agreement / AFL, we would encourage you to work together with the developer to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. Such mutually acceptable solutions can include partial payments.

*	If you cannot reach an agreement and would like to prevent the developer from terminating the S&P Agreement / AFL, you may serve a Notification for Relief on the developer, who is then prohibited from terminating the S&P Agreement / AFL or suing you during the prescribed period (i.e. up to <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a>).

*	In the event of a dispute over whether there is an inability to meet your payment obligations, or whether that inability is materially caused by COVID-19, either party may make an application for an Assessor’s determination. The Assessor will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Please click on this link for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.


**13.	Do I have to pay the accrued missed payments once the prescribed period is over?**

*	Yes. Your payment obligations continue to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a>. 

*	The Act seeks to temporarily prohibit the developer from terminating the S&P Agreement / AFL during the relief period.

*	This gives you some breathing space to sort out your finances, and time for you and the developer to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable solution. 


**14.	Can a developer charge me interest or other charges for late payment during the relief period, after I have served the Notification for Relief?**

*	If the S&P Agreement / AFL provides that the developer can charge interest or charges (be it for late payment or otherwise), those charges would accrue and can be enforced by the developer after the relief period. Do note that the late payment interest and charges will be subject to a cap. Please see <a href="#q15">FAQs (15) – (25)</a> for more details. 


<a name="q15">**15. What are the arrears that will be subject to the cap on late payment interest and charges?**</a>

* The cap applies in respect of arrears that accrued between 1 February 2020 and <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a> due to COVID-19. 


**16. What happens to arrears that have accrued before 1 February, or after <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a> (e.g., arrears for the month of Jan 2020)?**

* The relief does not apply to such arrears. The contractual late payment interest and charges will apply. 


**17. What is the cap on late payment interest or charges?**

* The cap is the amount equal to 5% per annum of simple interest on the arrears. 


**18. How does the cap on late payment interest rate and charges work?**

* Once the Notification for Relief is served, all late payment interest and charges that are chargeable on arrears that accrued between 1 February 2020 and <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a> will be capped at an amount equal to 5% per annum of simple interest.  

* Please click [here](/covid19-relief/cap-on-late-payment-interest-charges) for illustrations on how the cap on late payment interest and charges work.


**19. What happens if the developer insists that I pay interest or charges that exceed the cap?**

* You will not be liable to pay any late payment interest or charges that exceed the cap. 


**20. Am I still liable to pay the developer ordinary interest (if any)?**

* The cap only applies to <b><u>late payment</u></b> interest and charges. The usual interest and charges (if any) that the developer charges in the absence of any late payments is not capped. 


**21. Can parties agree to a late payment interest rate that is below the cap?**

* Yes. We encourage parties to work together to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. 


**22. I entered into a compromise or settlement with the developer before I served a Notification for Relief. Does this relief apply to me?**

* No, the relief will not apply if you have entered into a compromise or settlement before serving the Notification for Relief on the developer. 


**23. I have paid the developer late payment interest and charges above the cap. Can I serve a Notification for Relief on the developer and get a refund?**

* You cannot claim a refund of any late payment interest or charges that you have already paid. 


**24. I served the developer with a Notification for Relief before the cap on late payment interest and charges was brought into force on 31 July 2020. Does the cap apply to me? Do I need to serve the developer with another Notification for Relief?**

* Yes, the cap on late payment interest and charges can apply to you if you had sought relief in the Notification for Relief for an inability to perform a payment obligation(s) in the contract due to a COVID-19 event (e.g., unable to pay progress payments). The cap on late payment interest will apply even if you served the Notification for Relief before the cap was brought into force on 31 July 2020. You do not need to serve the developer with another Notification for Relief to qualify for the cap on late payment interest. 

**25. I applied for and received an Assessor’s Determination before the cap on late payment interest and charges was brought into force on 31 July 2020. Does the cap apply to me?**

* If your determination provides that section 5 of the Act applies in respect of your inability to make payment under the S&P Agreement / AFL, the cap on late payment interest and charges will apply to those payments that you were unable to make. You do not need to serve the developer with another Notification for Relief to qualify for the cap on late payment interest. 


**26.	What can I do if the developer threatens to terminate my S&P Agreement / AFL after I have served the Notification for Relief?**

*	If a Notification for Relief has been served, it will be an offence under the Act for the developer to terminate your S&P Agreement / AFL.

*	If your developer attempts to take an unlawful action, you may seek an injunction from the court prohibiting the termination. In this regard, you should seek legal advice on whether an injunction is available to you.

*	If there is a disagreement over the Notification for Relief, either party may also make an application for an Assessor’s determination. Please click on this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and relevant forms. 


**27.	I wish to terminate my S&P Agreement / AFL. Can I get a refund for the payments made before termination?**

*	The Act does not require the developer to refund the payments made (if any) under the S&P Agreement / AFL before termination. 

*	Whether you can get a refund for such payments will depend on the terms of the S&P Agreement / AFL. 


<u>For developers</u>


**28.	I have been served with a Notification for Relief.  However, I disagree that the buyer is unable to meet his/her payment obligations under the S&P Agreement / AFL due to COVID-19. Can I terminate the S&P Agreement / AFL?**

*	If a Notification for Relief has been served, it will be an offence under the Act for you to terminate the S&P Agreement / AFL.

*	If there is a disagreement over the Notification for Relief, either party may make an application for an Assessor’s determination. Please click on this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and relevant forms.


**29.	An intending buyer’s OTP is about to expire, and he/she has served me with a Notification for Relief. What should I do?**

*	Once the intending buyer has served you a Notification for Relief, you may not forfeit or withhold any part of the booking fee on or before <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a>. 

*	We would encourage parties to acknowledge that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on everyone, and therefore act reasonably and work together to reach a mutually acceptable solution.  This may include extending the OTP for a reasonable period of time, or agreeing on the amount of booking fee to be forfeited. 

*	If parties cannot agree, either party may make an application for an Assessor’s determination. The Assessor will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Please click on this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.


**30.	I cannot deliver vacant possession / rectify defects as required under the S&P Agreement / AFL. Does the Act offer any relief?**

*	If you are unable to carry out your contractual obligation under the S&P Agreement / AFL due to COVID-19, you are entitled to relief under the Act if the conditions below are met: 

    *	The S&P Agreement / AFL with the buyer was entered into before 25 March 2020 
    
    *	You are unable to carry out your contractual obligation under the S&P Agreement / AFL because of COVID-19 
    
    *	The contractual obligation is to be performed on or after 1 February 2020 
    
    *	You have served a Notification for Relief on the buyer

* If these conditions are met, the buyer cannot start or continue court or insolvency proceedings against you during the prescribed period (i.e. up to <a href="#31Decnote">30 June 2021</a>), in respect of the contractual obligation that you are unable to carry out.
* Part 2 of the Act does **not** remove or absolve parties’ contractual obligations, nor does it provide a defence against any liability for breach of contract or damages (e.g. liquidated damages) stemming from your inability to perform the contractual obligation due to COVID-19. 
* We encourage you to work together with the buyer to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. 
* In the event of a dispute over whether there is an inability to perform the contractual obligation, or whether that inability is materially caused by COVID-19, either party may make an application for an Assessor’s determination. 
* The Assessor will determine whether you are unable to deliver vacant possession / rectify defects due to COVID-19, and accordingly, whether section 5 applies. Please note that the Assessor is unable to comment or make a determination on other matters, such as whether there should be an extension of time for the developer to deliver vacant possession or to rectify defects, the amount of damages or liquidated damages (if any) payable by the developer, or any other contractual dispute.
