### Notification for Relief ###

**1. I am seeking waiver of rent for SMEs that has been announced by the Government.  Must I serve a Notification for Relief?**  
* No. Tenant occupiers, seeking rental waivers under the rental relief framework, <u>do not</u> have to serve a Notification for Relief on their landlord. 

* Under the rental relief framework, eligible Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and specified Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) which are tenant-occupiers who operate their business in a rented property (including sub-tenants, licensees and sub-licensees) can receive up to 4 months waiver of rent for qualifying commercial properties (e.g. shops) and up to 2 months waiver of rent for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties). 

* The Amendment Act also provides for an automatic moratorium on enforcement actions against tenant occupiers for non-payment of rent under the lease or licence agreement. The moratorium has taken effect on 31 July 2020 and will end on the date a notice of cash grant is issued by IRAS to the property owner or 31 December 2020, whichever is earlier.

* For more information on the rental relief framework, please click [here](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-smes). 

**2. I am seeking relief under the Re-Align Framework. Must I serve a Notification for Relief under section 5 of the Act?**
* No. The Re-Align Framework is a separate and different relief regime.
* A Notification for Relief is **not** a notice under the Re-Align Framework. Instead, you should serve a Notice of Negotiation. However, the Re-Align Framework has not come into force. Further information on the notice that has to be served will be announced at [this page](https://go.gov.sg/re-align) when the Re-Align Framework comes into force.

<u>I am the party seeking relief and sender of the Notification for Relief…</u>

**10. I served a Notification for Relief (either using the online system, or by downloading and sending the hard-copy form to the other party to the contract). Do I need to file the Notification for Relief with the Ministry of Law? Does the Ministry of Law need to “approve” my Notification for Relief before it is valid?**

*	You may wish to reach out to the other party to ensure that he received the Notification for Relief. 
*	Thereafter, we encourage you to engage the other party to reach a mutually acceptable solution. Both sides must be fair and reasonable.

Please refer to this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for more information on the application process.  

**12. I served the Notification for Relief, and I filed the Application for an Assessor’s Determination. Since then, the other party and I have reached a mutually acceptable solution without having to go through the proceedings before the Assessor. What do I do now?**

<u>I am the receiver of a Notification for Relief…</u>

**13. The party seeking relief indicated a “proposal” in Part D of the Notification for Relief. Is that proposal binding?** 
*	No. It is merely a proposal from the party seeking relief for the other party’s consideration. We encourage you to use the proposal as a basis to start negotiations. 

**14. I was served a Notification for Relief. I disagree with my counterparty’s proposal in Part D of the Notification for Relief. What do I do next? Must I serve a Notification for Relief as well?** 
*	We encourage you to reach out to your counterparty, negotiate and come to a mutually agreeable solution. 
*	There is no need for you to serve a Notification for Relief on your counterparty as well.

**15. I am not a party to the contract, but was erroneously served a Notification for Relief. What do I do next?** 
*	If it is a mistake, you may contact the sender of the Notification for Relief to inform him about the error, or ignore the erroneous Notification for Relief. 
*	If it appears that the sender had sent you the Notification for Relief because he believes you are a party to the contract (when you are not a party to the contract),  you may dispute the Notification for Relief by making an application to the Assessor using this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor).

**16. I was served a Notification for Relief even though my contract with the party seeking relief does not fall within the Act. What do I do next?**
*	Even though the Notification for Relief was served in error, this indicates that your counterparty has difficulties meeting his contractual obligations to you under your contract. We encourage you to reach out to your counterparty to inform him that the contract does not fall within the Act and to reach a mutually acceptable solution to deal with any contractual issues that have been caused by COVID-19. 
*	If you are unable to reach an agreement with the counterparty and you wish to dispute the Notification for Relief, you may make an application to the Assessor by following the steps in this [link](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor). The Assessor will determine whether relief under the Act applies. 

**17. I was served multiple Notification for Reliefs by the same party, all with slightly different details. What do I do next?**
*	You may wish to reach out to the sender of the Notification for Relief to clarify which document he wishes to rely on.

**18. I was served the Notification for Relief and I filed an Application for an Assessor’s Determination. Since then, the other party and I have reached a mutually acceptable solution without having to go through the proceedings before the Assessor. What should I do now?** 
*	For the pending Application, you should inform the Registrar of the settlement and that you wish to withdraw the Application. You may do so by writing to the Registry’s email address from which the acknowledgment of receipt of the Application was sent to you.
