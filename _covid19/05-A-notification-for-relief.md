### Notification for Relief ### 

We recommend that both parties first discuss, understand each other’s positions, and try to reach a compromise, taking into account the framework set out in the Act as well as the rental relief framework set out in the Amendment Act.

<u>A Notification for Relief is <b>NOT</b> a Notice under the Re-Align Framework</u>

The Re-Align Framework is a separate and different relief regime.

Under the Re-Align Framework, eligible businesses which have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 can renegotiate certain types of contracts, to realign with the current economic conditions, failing which the businesses may seek to terminate those contracts. As an alternative to contract termination, the Re-Align Framework provides eligible hirers and renters of commercial equipment and vehicles to take up a Repayment Scheme to pay outstanding arrears in instalments. A party who wishes to seek relief under the Re-Align Framework would have to serve a notice on their contracting party. 

The Re-Align Framework has not come into force. Further information on the notice that has to be served will be announced at [this page](https://go.gov.sg/re-align) when the Re-Align Framework comes into force. 


<!--
The rental relief framework is a separate and different relief regime under a different Part of the Act.

Under the rental relief framework, eligible Small and Medium NOT a Notice under the Re-Align FrameworkEnterprises (SMEs) and specified non-profit organisations (NPOs) can get up to 4 months waiver of rent for qualifying commercial properties and up to 2 months waiver of rent for industrial / office properties.

Eligible tenant occupiers, seeking rental relief waivers <u>DO NOT need</u> to serve a Notification for Relief on their landlord. Please check if you fall within one of the following scenarios:

* If you are a SME and believe that you are eligible for rental waivers, but have not heard from the landlord or received the Notice of Cash Grant, you may make an application to IRAS at [https://go.gov.sg/governmentcashgrant](https://go.gov.sg/governmentcashgrant){:target="_blank"} from 21 August 2020 to 21 October 2020.
* If your landlord has served you the Notice of Cash Grant issued by IRAS, you DO NOT need to serve a Notification for Relief on your landlord or do anything further. The rental waivers apply automatically upon receipt of the Notice of Cash Grant by your landlord. You simply do not need to pay rent for the applicable period to the landlord.
* If you received the Notice of Cash Grant, but have already paid rent for those months for which rent should have been waived (e.g. April and May), you may simply apply the waiver to future rent (e.g. waive the rent for October and November). You DO NOT need to request that your landlord return the April and May rent to you. If there is insufficient time left in the lease, you can obtain a refund from your landlord. If the landlord refuses to make the refund, please seek independent legal advice on how to commence legal proceedings to claim the refund.  You do not need to serve a Notification for Relief.

Apart from rental waivers, the rental relief framework also provides for an automatic moratorium on enforcement actions against tenant occupiers for non-payment of rent under the lease or licence agreement, as well as a statutory repayment plan for arrears.
