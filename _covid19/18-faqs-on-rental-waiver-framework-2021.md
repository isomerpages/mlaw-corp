### General ###

Q1.	Why has the Government decided to implement the Rental Waiver Framework?

Q2.	Now that the Act has been passed in Parliament, what should I expect next?

Q3.	What should landlords and tenants do in the meantime, before receiving the Notice of Rental Waiver?


**Q1.	Why has the Government decided to implement the Rental Waiver Framework?**

The Rental Waiver Framework (RWF) complements the suite of support measures introduced by the Ministry of Finance to alleviate the economic impact on businesses due to the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) [P2(HA)] periods. 

To ensure a fair sharing of rental obligations over the P2(HA) periods between the Government, landlords and tenants, landlords are mandated to provide 2 weeks of rental waiver of gross rent under the RWF to eligible tenants. 

Taken together with the Rental Support Scheme (RSS) cash payouts, eligible tenants in qualifying privately owned commercial properties will benefit from a total of 1.5 months of rental support. 

**Q2.	Now that the Act has been passed in Parliament, what should I expect next?**

[For tenants] 

You can expect to receive a Notice of Rental Waiver (Notice) from the Ministry of Law in the first half of October 2021, especially if you have received one or more payouts under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS) administered by IRAS. 

It is important to note that receipt of the Notice does not automatically qualify you for rental waiver from your landlord. 

Upon receiving the Notice, you should first assess if you meet all the eligibility criteria here .

If you determine that you meet all the eligibility criteria, you will have to take the necessary steps as set out in the Notice, within the specified timeline, to obtain the rental waiver.

You may not receive the Notice if you rent only part of a property or a mixed-use property (e.g. a shophouse for both retail and residential use), and/or are a licensee. 

If you did not receive the Notice, but are of the view that you are eligible for the RSS and/or the Rental Waiver Framework (refer to full criteria here ), you may make an application subsequently. More details will be provided when applications open on 1 November 2021. 

[For landlords]

Your tenant may receive a Notice of Rental Waiver (Notice) from the Ministry of Law in the first half of October 2021, especially if your tenant has received one or more payouts under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS) administered by IRAS. 

Upon receipt of the Notice, your tenant will have to assess if he/she is meets the eligibility criteria to receive the rental waiver from you. If your tenant determines that he/she is eligible, he/she will have to serve a copy of the Notice and relevant supporting documents to you. 

If you are the property owner and have received the Notice and the other documents from your tenant, you are required to provide the rental waiver as set out in the Notice to your tenant.

If you are a landlord and have received the Notice and the other supporting documents from your tenant, but are not the property owner (i.e. you are subletting the property as an intermediary landlord):

i.	You are required to provide the rental waiver as set out in the Notice to your tenant.
ii.	As an intermediary landlord, you will also be eligible for the same amount of rental waiver from your landlord, up to a cap of 2 weeks of your own gross rent. To obtain the rental waiver from your landlord, please follow the instructions for service applicable to an intermediary landlord as set out in the Notice.

**Q3.	What should landlords and tenants do in the meantime, before receiving the Notice of Rental Waiver?**

Prior to receiving the Notice of Rental Waiver, tenants should continue to honour their existing contractual obligations. 


### Rental Waiver Obligations ###
 
Q4.	How is rent defined? / What components of the rent are used in the calculation of the rental waiver? 

Q5.	Why are service and maintenance charges included in the rental waivers? 

Q6.	Can the rental waivers be offset by any waivers or other forms of assistance that a landlord had provided to his tenant prior to the implementation of the Act? What can be considered for the offset? 

Q7.	Are landlords allowed to offset the assistance (e.g. parking promotions, waiver of e-platform fees, or marketing support ) that they had provided to their tenants? 


**Q4.	How is rent defined? / What components of the rent are used in the calculation of the rental waiver?**

The 2 weeks of rental waiver will be based on gross rent. Gross rent is what is agreed on under the lease agreement or licence, and will include gross turnover rent, maintenance fees and service charges.

**Q5.	Why are service and maintenance charges included in the rental waivers?**

As the gross rent is most reflective of the actual rental expenses that businesses incur, the Government had provided 1 month of gross rent cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme. For consistency, the Rental Waiver Framework will also be based on gross rent.

**Q6.	Can the rental waivers be offset by any waivers or other forms of assistance that a landlord had provided to his tenant prior to the implementation of the Act? What can be considered for the offset?**

Generally, landlords may offset any direct monetary assistance or rental waivers provided to their tenants from 16 May 2021 up to the date the landlord receives all of the tenant’s supporting documents (both dates inclusive). 

The landlord must provide any remaining rental waiver after offsetting the assistance and/or waivers as detailed above. 

**Q7.	Are landlords allowed to offset the assistance (e.g. parking promotions, waiver of e-platform fees, or marketing support ) that they had provided to their tenants?**

Only direct monetary assistance or rental waivers to the tenant may be offset. 


### Eligibility ###

Q8.	How are qualifying commercial properties defined? 

Q9.	Why are offices and industrial properties, as well as properties used for residential purposes (e.g. dormitories) not entitled to rental waivers in this round of rental relief? 

Q10.	How were the categories of non-profit organisations (NPOs) considered eligible for the rental waiver determined? 

Q11.	Why was 20 July 2021 adopted as the cut-off date for the tenancy to be eligible for rental waiver? 

Q12.	The Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions were partially relaxed from 10 August 2021. Why is there still a need to require landlords to provide the 2 weeks of rental waiver to eligible tenants, when it is linked to the period of 5 to 18 August 2021? 

Q13.	Why is Phase 3 used as the base reference period for revenue drop comparison rather than pre-COVID? 

Q14.	What if my business had only commenced operations after the start of Phase 3 (i.e. after 28 December 2020) – how will the drop in revenue be assessed? 

Q15.	If my business started after 15 May 2021, there is no base reference period for me to compare against to determine my revenue drop. Does it mean that I am not eligible for rental waiver?	

Q16.	What does it mean to be a part of a “Singapore group of entities”? 

Q17.	For the purposes of qualifying for the Rental Waiver Framework, why has the criteria for SMEs at group level (i.e. aggregate group annual revenue not more than $100m) been limited to related entities or parent companies incorporated or established in Singapore? 


**Types of Properties**

**Q8.	How are qualifying commercial properties defined?**

Examples of qualifying commercial uses include shops, restaurants, cinemas or theatres, schools, etc. The full list may be found here . 

**Q9.	Why are offices and industrial properties, as well as properties used for residential purposes (e.g. dormitories) not entitled to rental waivers in this round of rental relief?**

The Rental Waiver Framework is intended to provide support to businesses that have been impacted by the tightened safe management measures during the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) [P2(HA)].

Commercial businesses have been particularly affected due to lower footfall during this period. In contrast, industrial tenants were generally allowed to continue with operations during P2(HA). Similarly, most office tenants could continue operations with their staff working from home. 


**SME/NPO**

**Q10.	How were the categories of non-profit organisations (NPOs) considered eligible for the rental waiver determined?**

The framework provides the rental waiver to selected NPOs that are deemed to benefit businesses, the society or community at large, to also give them time and support to recover from the impact of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). These NPOs will also be subject to similar criteria as businesses/SMEs. 

**Lease Eligibility**

**Q11.	Why was 20 July 2021 adopted as the cut-off date for the tenancy to be eligible for rental waiver?**

20 July 2021 was the date when the second Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) was announced. Tenants who entered into rental agreements after the announcement should have been aware of the risks and potential impact of the latest round of tightening measures. 

**Q12.	The Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions were partially relaxed from 10 August 2021. Why is there still a need to require landlords to provide the 2 weeks of rental waiver to eligible tenants, when it is linked to the period of 5 to 18 August 2021?**

Only tenants who were impacted during both Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) [P2(HA)] periods, i.e. their average monthly revenue must have dropped by 20% or more during both P2(HA) periods compared to the Phase 3 period, are eligible for the rental waiver. If a business was able to make a significant recovery after the partial relaxation of restrictions from 10 August 2021, it would not be eligible for rental waiver from the landlord.


**Revenue Drop**

**Q13.	Why is Phase 3 used as the base reference period for revenue drop comparison rather than pre-COVID?**

The Rental Waiver Framework is intended to assist Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and specified Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) affected by the tightened safe management measures during the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) [P2(HA)] periods. 

Hence, the preceding period, i.e. Phase 3, is used as the base period for assessing the drop in revenue.

**Q14.	What if my business had only commenced operations after the start of Phase 3 (i.e. after 28 December 2020) – how will the drop in revenue be assessed?**

If your business commenced after 28 December 2020, the drop in average monthly revenue will be calculated by comparing both Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) periods (16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021 and 22 July 2021 to 18 August 2021) to the period from the business commencement date to 15 May 2021 (both dates inclusive).

**Q15.	If my business started after 15 May 2021, there is no base reference period for me to compare against to determine my revenue drop. Does it mean that I am not eligible for rental waiver?**

Only tenant-occupiers who have operated for the entirety of both Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) [P2(HA)] periods will be eligible for the Rental Waiver Framework. Otherwise, it would not be possible to ascertain that your revenue had been impacted by the restrictions during the P2(HA) periods.

Your business may nevertheless be eligible for the first tranche of the Rental Support Scheme (RSS) if your lease was signed before 14 May 2021 and was in force any time between 14 to 29 May 2021. You may also be eligible for the second tranche of the RSS if your lease was signed before 20 July 2021 and was in force any time between 22 July to 18 August 2021.  

**Group SME**

**Q16.	What does it mean to be a part of a “Singapore group of entities”?**

If your business is not part of any group of companies, this does not apply to you.

“Singapore group of entities” refers to a group of entities that are incorporated or established in Singapore and related to each other through ownership or control in such a way that the group is either required to prepare consolidated financial statements for financial reporting purposes (i) under FRS 110 or an equivalent accounting standard or (ii) due to equity interests in any of the entities were traded on any stock exchange in Singapore. 

If the business is a member of a Singapore group of entities in the period 16 May 2021 to 18 August 2021, the group’s annual revenue must be not more than $100 million for the business to qualify for the rental waiver . 

**Q17.	For the purposes of qualifying for the Rental Waiver Framework, why has the criteria for SMEs at group level (i.e. aggregate group annual revenue not more than $100m) been limited to related entities or parent companies incorporated or established in Singapore?** 

Revenues accounted for outside of Singapore would not be an accurate reflection of the size of the business in Singapore, and their need for rental waiver as a result of the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions.


### Service Requirement ###

Q18. What if I do not have the necessary supporting documents?

Q19.What if I cannot prepare the necessary supporting documents and complete service within 28 calendar days?

Q20. What are profit and loss statements?

Q21.	What should I do if I do not know my landlord’s email or address, or he does not want to give it to me?/ Why must I send documents via email or registered post?/ Can service be done by normal post?/ Can service be done by WhatsApp?

Q22. My landlord insists that I need to do a Statutory Declaration even when I provide profit and loss statements. Is this really necessary?


**Q18.	What if I do not have the necessary supporting documents?**

If you do not have the necessary profit and loss statements required for determining the revenue drop for your business at the subject location, you must provide a copy of a Statutory Declaration attesting that you meet the relevant eligibility criteria in Section 1 of the Declaration Form (of the Notice of Rental Waiver).

A statutory declaration made in Singapore must be in the form set out in the First Schedule of the Oaths and Declarations Act (Cap. 211) and be made before a Commissioner for Oaths, Notary Public or a Justice of the Peace. The following links contain a list of Commissioners/Notaries/Justices, who may be contacted for further assistance: https://go.gov.sg/conp-list and https://go.gov.sg/jp-list.

**Q19.	What if I cannot prepare the necessary supporting documents and complete service within 28 calendar days?**

The timeline of 28 calendar days for complete service of the Notice of Rental Waiver and necessary supporting documents should be strictly adhered to. If you are unable to fulfil this condition, your landlord can make an application to the rental waiver assessors to assess your eligibility on the grounds that you have not complied with the service requirements as set out in the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act. If the rental waiver assessor determines that you did not comply with the service requirements, you may no longer be eligible to receive the rental waiver.

**Q20.	What are profit and loss statements?**

A profit and loss statement is a financial statement that summarises the revenue, costs, and expenses incurred over a specified period.

**Q21.	What should I do if I do not know my landlord’s email or address, or he does not want to give it to me?/ Why must I send documents via email or registered post?/ Can service be done by normal post?/ Can service be done by WhatsApp?**

The standard mode of service is by email or registered post. However, we understand there may be instances where the tenant/intermediary landlord is unable to obtain the email or mailing address of its immediate landlord. Under such circumstances, the tenant/intermediary landlord may serve the necessary documents via internet-based messaging services, like WhatsApp or Telegram. 

Nonetheless, you are strongly encouraged to complete service by email to minimise potential disputes on your compliance with the steps in the Notice for Rental Waiver.

**Q22.	My landlord insists that I need to do a Statutory Declaration even when I provide profit and loss statements. Is this really necessary?**

If you are unable to produce one or more of the required documents specified in Section 2 of the Declaration Form, you are required to make a Statutory Declaration on your ability to meet the relevant criteria specified in Section 1 of the Declaration Form. However, if you are able to produce all the required statements, you do not need to make a Statutory Declaration.


### Assessment by a rental waiver assessor ###

Q23.	Will tenants have access to the assessment mechanism, either to challenge a landlord’s assertion of financial hardship, or to ascertain whether they are eligible?

Q24.	What if my landlord insists that I am not eligible/ says I did not fulfil complete service of documents within 28 calendar days? 

Q25.	What can a landlord do if he is not satisfied that his tenant is eligible for the rental waiver after reviewing the documents provided by his tenant? 

Q26.	What documents must a landlord submit to prove his eligibility for financial hardship?	

Q27.	If a landlord had granted short-term lease extensions to his tenants with significant rental reductions, can this reduce his rental waiver obligations? 


**Q23.	Will tenants have access to the assessment mechanism, either to challenge a landlord’s assertion of financial hardship, or to ascertain whether they are eligible?**

Where a tenant has assessed that he/she is eligible and has sent a copy of the Notice of Rental Waiver, along with the completed Declaration Form and all necessary supporting documents, to his/her immediate landlord, the landlord cannot unilaterally decide that the tenant is ineligible for the rental waiver. Any adjustment to the landlord’s rental waiver obligations is only made after the assessor has made a determination on the matter.

Your rental waiver continues to apply while you await the outcome of the assessment. 

**Q24.	What if my landlord insists that I am not eligible/ says I did not fulfil complete service of documents within 28 calendar days?**

Where a tenant has assessed that he/she is eligible and sent a copy of the Notice of Rental Waiver, along with copies of the completed Declaration Form and all necessary supporting documents to his/her immediate landlord, the landlord cannot unilaterally decide that the tenant is ineligible for rental waiver. 

Landlords and tenants are encouraged to work towards a mutual arrangement to implement the rental waiver provided for in the Act.

If the landlord and tenant-occupier are unable to reach an agreement on the tenant’s eligibility, the property owner and/or any intermediary landlord(s) may make an application within 14 calendar days of receiving the Notice of Rental Waiver and necessary supporting documents (or copies of them), to have a rental waiver assessor ascertain whether the tenant-occupier is eligible under the Rental Waiver Framework. Any adjustment to the landlord’s rental waiver obligations is only made after a rental waiver assessor has made a determination on the matter. The rental waiver continues to apply while parties await the outcome of the assessment.

More details on the application process will be shared in due course.

Landlords may submit an application within 14 calendar days of receiving copies of the Notice of Rental Waiver and supporting documents, to have a rental waiver assessor ascertain whether their rental waiver obligation may be offset by the assistance that they had provided. More details on the application process will be shared in due course.


### Dispute Resolution ###

Q28.	I have determined myself to be eligible and have completed service of all the necessary documents. Hence, I have not paid my rental arrears of 2 weeks. If I am subsequently assessed to be ineligible under the assessment mechanism, will I be liable for the late payment and interest charge associated with this amount? 

Q29.	Can a landlord take enforcement action against tenants for non-payment of rent pending the tenant-occupier’s receipt of the Notice of Rental Waiver? 


**Q28.	I have determined myself to be eligible and have completed service of all the necessary documents. Hence, I have not paid my rental arrears of 2 weeks. If I am subsequently assessed to be ineligible under the assessment mechanism, will I be liable for the late payment and interest charge associated with this amount?**

Yes. You will be liable for the late payment and interest charge associated with the 2 weeks of rental waiver, if you are subsequently assessed not to be eligible. As such, we urge that you make a careful assessment of your ability to qualify for the Rental Waiver Framework before proceeding with the necessary steps to claim the rental waiver.

**Q29.	Can a landlord take enforcement action against tenants for non-payment of rent pending the tenant-occupier’s receipt of the Notice of Rental Waiver?**

Tenants should comply with their contractual obligations prior to receiving the Notice of Rental Waiver, as they may otherwise be subject to enforcement action.  We nevertheless encourage landlords and tenants to discuss and find mutually agreeable arrangements, taking into account any rental waiver that the tenant may be eligible to receive.  


### Intermediary Landlords ###

Q30.	Will intermediary landlords also receive rental waivers if their tenant is an eligible tenant-occupier? Do they also have to meet the eligibility criteria for rental waiver? 

Q31.	What happens if the rent which an intermediary landlord collects from his tenant is higher than the rent he pays to his landlord? Will he be required to absorb the difference in granting the rental waivers? 

Q32.	I am an intermediary landlord and my property is subdivided. How much rental waiver am I supposed to give my tenant and how much rental waiver will I get from my landlord? 

Q33.	Why does an intermediary landlord only get 7 days to serve the documents to its immediate landlord? 


**Q30.	Will intermediary landlords also receive rental waivers if their tenant is an eligible tenant-occupier? Do they also have to meet the eligibility criteria for rental waiver?** 

If the eligible tenant-occupier rents the property through an intermediary landlord, the intermediary landlord will also receive the same amount of rental waiver from their own immediate landlord, up to a cap of 2 weeks of the gross rent of the intermediary landlord. This applies regardless of whether the intermediary landlord meets the eligibility criteria. An intermediary landlord’s entitlement to rental waivers is solely dependent on the tenant-occupier’s eligibility. To obtain the rental waiver, the intermediary landlord will have to complete the necessary steps set out in the Notice of Rental Waiver within the specified timeline. 

**Q31.	What happens if the rent which an intermediary landlord collects from his tenant is higher than the rent he pays to his landlord? Will he be required to absorb the difference in granting the rental waivers?**

An intermediary landlord will be required to provide the full 2 weeks of rental waiver to their tenant. Hence, if the rent which an intermediary landlord collects from his tenant is higher than the rent he pays to his landlord, the intermediary landlord is required to absorb the difference. 

**Q32.	I am an intermediary landlord and my property is subdivided. How much rental waiver am I supposed to give my tenant and how much rental waiver will I get from my landlord?**

Under the Rental Waiver Framework (RWF), the amount of rental waiver to be given to each sub-tenant/ licensee who meets all of the eligibility criteria, will be 2 weeks of their payable rent. 

Where the intermediary landlord has subdivided the property to rent to multiple eligible tenant-occupiers, the rental relief that the property owner has to provide to the master tenant will generally be equivalent to the total rental waiver that the master tenant had granted to eligible sub-tenants but not exceeding 2 weeks of the rent paid by the intermediary landlord to its landlord. This is illustrated in the table below. 

Rental waiver given by
intermediary landlord	Monthly rent paid by intermediary landlord to its landlord	Rental waiver that intermediary landlord is entitled to
$10,000	$31,000	$10,000
$20,000		$14,000 
(capped at 2 weeks of own rent)
$30,000		

**Q33.	Why does an intermediary landlord only get 7 days to serve the documents to its immediate landlord?** 

Intermediary landlords should require a shorter time for complete service as compared to tenant-occupiers, since they do not need to prepare any additional documents, and are just required to send to their immediate landlord the copies of all the documents received from their tenant. 


### Others ###

Q34.	What other financial assistance measures are available to landlords? 


**Q34.	What other financial assistance measures are available to landlords?**

MAS has worked with banks and finance companies on various relief measures to support individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19.

Landlords facing cash flow difficulties can apply to banks and finance companies for credit relief. Eligible individual landlords can make reduced instalments on their commercial and industrial property loans for up to 9 months, or 31 December 2021, whichever is earlier. A loan tenure extension of up to 3 years can also be discussed with lenders. 

SME and larger corporate landlords can likewise work with their banks and finance companies on suitable repayment schedules if they require assistance.

Those who need to access additional credit to meet their immediate cashflow needs can either apply for mortgage equity withdrawal loans, or loans under ESG’s Temporary Bridging Loan Programme or Working Capital Loan Scheme.

Please refer to this link to find out more about the relief measures announced by MAS and the financial industry: www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/covid-19.
