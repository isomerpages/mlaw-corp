Q1.	Why has the Government decided to implement the Rental Waiver Framework?

The Rental Waiver Framework (RWF) complements the suite of support measures introduced by the Ministry of Finance to alleviate the economic impact on businesses due to the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) [P2(HA)] periods. 

To ensure a fair sharing of rental obligations over the P2(HA) periods between the Government, landlords and tenants, landlords are mandated to provide 2 weeks of rental waiver of gross rent under the RWF to eligible tenants. 

Taken together with the Rental Support Scheme (RSS) cash payouts, eligible tenants in qualifying privately owned commercial properties will benefit from a total of 1.5 months of rental support. 

Q2.	Now that the Act has been passed in Parliament, what should I expect next? 

[For tenants] 

Starting from October 2021, yYou can expect to receive a Notice of Rental Waiver (Notice) from the Ministry of Law in the first half of October 2021, especially if you have received one or more payouts under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS) administered by IRAS. 

It is important to note that receipt of the Notice does not automatically qualify you for rental waiver from your landlord. 

Upon receiving the Notice, you should first assess if you meet all the eligibility criteria here .

If you determine that you meet all the eligibility criteria, you will have to take the necessary steps as set out in the Notice, within the specified timeline, to obtain the rental waiver.

You may not receive the Notice if you rent only part of a property or a mixed-use property (e.g. a shophouse for both retail and residential use), and/or are a licensee. 

If you did not receive the Notice, but are of the view that you are eligible for the RSS and/or the Rental Waiver Framework (refer to full criteria here ), you may make an application subsequently. More details will be provided when applications open on 1 November 2021. 

[For landlords]

Starting from October 2021, yYour tenant may receive a Notice of Rental Waiver (Notice) from the Ministry of Law in the first half of October 2021, especially if your tenant has received one or more payouts under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS) administered by IRAS. 

Upon receipt of the Notice, your tenant will have to assess if he/she is meets the eligibility criteria to receive the rental waiver from you. If your tenant determines that he/she is eligible, he/she will have to serve a copy of the Notice and relevant supporting documents to you. 

If you are the property owner and have received the Notice and the other documents from your tenant, you are required to provide the rental waiver as set out in the Notice to your tenant.

If you are a landlord and have received the Notice and the other supporting documents from your tenant, but are not the property owner (i.e. you are subletting the property as an intermediary landlord):

i.	You are required to provide the rental waiver as set out in the Notice to your tenant.
ii.	As an intermediary landlord, you will also be eligible for the same amount of rental waiver from your landlord, up to a cap of 2 weeks of your own gross rent. To obtain the rental waiver from your landlord, please follow the instructions for service applicable to an intermediary landlord as set out in the Notice.

Q3.	What should landlords and tenants do in the meantime, before receiving the Notice of Rental Waiver? 

Prior to receiving the Notice of Rental Waiver, tenants should continue to honour their existing contractual obligations.
