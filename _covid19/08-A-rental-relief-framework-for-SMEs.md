### Rental Relief Framework for SMEs and NPOs in 2020 ###

<u>Important Note</u>: The Rental Relief Framework covered periods from April to May 2020 or April to July 2020. The acceptance of applications has concluded.

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment) Act (“Act”) that was passed in Parliament on 5 June 2020 provided a rental relief framework for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and specified non-profit organisations (NPOs). This framework came into force on 31 July 2020. 

The rental relief framework provided for mandated equitable co-sharing of rental obligations between the Government, landlords and tenants. This helped affected SMEs that needed more time and support to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework also covered eligible NPO tenants.
