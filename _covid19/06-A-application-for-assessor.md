### Steps in the Proceedings ###

You should only make an application for an Assessor’s Determination (“<b>Application</b>”) if you are unable to come to an agreement with the other party or parties to the contract. 

Please note that the outcome of the **Application** will be final. There will be no appeals from the Assessor’s determination. 

Please take note of the following deadlines to file an application for an Assessor’s Determination: 

| <b>Deadline to file an application for an Assessor’s Determination</b> | <b>Categories of Contracts</b>
| <b>19 November 2020</b> | -- Leases and licences of non-residential property* <br>-- Hire-purchase and conditional sales agreements with banks or MAS-regulated finance companies for commercial vehicles, or plant/machinery used for commercial purposes* <br>-- Loans to SMEs secured by certain collateral in Singapore*
| <b>31 January 2021</b> | -- Hire-purchase and conditional sales agreements with financing companies (other than banks or MAS-regulated finance companies) for commercial vehicles, or plant/machinery used for commercial purposes* <br>-- Rental agreements for commercial equipment or commercial vehicles*
| <b>31 March 2021</b> | -- Event and tourism-related contracts  
| <b>30 June 2021</b> | -- Sale and puchase agreements with developers*
| <b>31 August 2021</b> | -- Options to purchase with developers 
| <b>30 April 2022</b> | -- Construction contracts or supply contracts, or any performance bond granted thereto

\* The role of an Assessor in these cases is to determine whether the moratorium (i.e. temporary relief from legal and enforcement action) applies. An Assessor’s determination is no longer necessary after the expiry of the prescribed period, as the moratorium automatically lapses when the prescribed period expires. 

<u>Important Note if You Are Seeking Rental Relief</u>

If  you are a SME tenant seeking rental waivers under the [rental relief framework](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/rental-relief-framework-for-smes), you DO NOT need to make an application for an Assessor’s determination under Part 2 of the Act. Please check if you fall within one of the following scenarios: 

* If you are a SME and believe that you are eligible for rental waivers, but have not heard from the landlord or received the Notice of Cash Grant, you may make an application to IRAS at [https://go.gov.sg/governmentcashgrant](https://go.gov.sg/governmentcashgrant){:target="_blank"} from 21 August 2020 to 21 October 2020.
* If your landlord has served you the Notice of Cash Grant issued by IRAS, you DO NOT need to make an application for an Assessor’s determination or do anything further. The rental waivers apply automatically upon receipt of the Notice of Cash Grant by your landlord. You simply do not need to pay rent for the applicable period to the landlord.
* If you received the Notice of Cash Grant, but have already paid rent for those months for which rent should have been waived (e.g. April and May), you may simply apply the waiver to future rent (e.g. waive the rent for October and November). You DO NOT need to request that your landlord return the April and May rent to you. If there is insufficient time left in the lease, you can obtain a refund from your landlord. If the landlord refuses to make the refund, please seek independent legal advice on how to commence legal proceedings to claim the refund.  You do not need to make an application for an Assessor’s determination.

If there is any disagreement on the tenant’s eligibility for the rental waivers, the landlord may make an application to have a rental relief assessor ascertain the tenant’s eligibility.

##### Step 3: Applicant Serves Documents on Respondent #####
Within <b>2 working days</b> after receiving the documents from the Registrar in Step 2, the Applicant must serve a copy of the <b>Application for an Assessor's Determination</b>, together with <b>the documents received from the Registrar in Step 2</b>, on the following **Recipients**, where applicable:

The documents can be served on the Recipient(s) by the [other modes of service](/covid19-relief/other-modes-service).

##### Step 4: Applicant Submits Declaration of Service #####
The Applicant must submit to the Registrar a **Declaration of Service** demonstrating that service to the Recipient(s) as required in Step 3 has been carried out. The submission of the **Declaration of Service** must be within **1 working day** of completing Step 3.

**Submission and service by other modes if you are unable to use the electronic system**

If you are unable to submit and serve the Response using the electronic system, please download the Response using this [form](/files/covid19-forms/form-8.docx) and: 

a.	Send the form to the Registrar by way of email as provided in the acknowledgment of receipt of the Application which was served on you (you should cite the Application No. in your email request); and  
b.	Serve the form on the Recipient(s) using the [other modes of service](/covid19-relief/other-modes-service). 

Please note that if the Respondent fails to submit a <b>Response</b>, the Registrar may proceed to appoint an Assessor, and the Assessor may make a determination on the <b>Application</b>, which will be binding on all parties to the <b>Application</b>.

##### Step 6: Registrar Sets Appointment for Hearing #####
If the Registrar is satisfied that Steps 3, 4 and 5 have been duly completed, the Registrar will send to the Applicant and Respondent by way of email:
* A notice of the appointment of an Assessor; and
* If applicable, a notice of the date and place for the hearing.

Please note that the Registrar may proceed to appoint an Assessor and to fix a hearing where the Respondent fails to file a <b>Response</b> within the relevant period in Step 5. 

##### Step 7: Assessor Conducts Hearing and Makes Determination #####
The hearing will generally be conducted by way of <u>exchange of emails</u>. The Assessor may request for clarifications or further documents by email.

If the Assessor is of the opinion that the interest of justice would be better served by an <u>online or physical hearing</u>:
* Online hearings will be conducted via Webex.
* Physical hearings will be held at the State Courts Towers (1 Havelock Square, Singapore 059724) or other venue as advised by the Registrar.

Please note for online or physical hearings:
* An Assessor may permit a party to be accompanied by an interpreter at the hearing. The party will be responsible for sourcing their own interpreter.
* No party may be represented by an advocate and solicitor at proceedings before an Assessor.

If a party to a determination is <u>absent</u> from the hearing, the Assessor may dismiss the application or make a determination on the case.

If the party had a good reason for being absent, they may make an application to set aside the dismissal or determination made in their absence. See [Application to Set Aside a Dismissal or Determination](/covid19-relief/set-aside-dismissal-or-determination).
  
##### Step 8: Registrar Informs Applicant and Respondent of Assessor’s Determination #####
After the Assessor has made a determination, the Registrar will inform the Applicant, the Respondent, and all other parties who were served the <b>Application for an Assessor's Determination</b>.

There is no appeal against an Assessor’s determination and it will be binding on all parties to the Application.

The records of the determination will be kept by the Registrar until 20 October 2022.

The Registrar may publish the facts of the case, the arguments and the determination without disclosing the names of the parties concerned or any information that may disclose their identities.
