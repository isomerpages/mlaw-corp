### Withdrawal of Notification for Relief ###

##### Step 1 #####
If you served a <b>Notification for Relief</b> on one or more of the following Recipient(s) and wish to withdraw it, you must serve a <b>Withdrawal of Notification for Relief</b> on the Recipient(s):
* The other party or parties to the contract;
* Any guarantor or surety for the obligations in the contract; and
* The Issuer of a Related Performance Bond.

**Service by the electronic system**

To serve the <b>Withdrawal of Notification for Relief</b> on the Recipient(s) using the electronic system (if you have an email address and the email address(es) of the Recipient(s)):
* If you are acting on behalf of an entity that is a party to the contract, please use this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/withdrawal-of-notification-corppass){:target="_blank"}.
* If you are an individual who is a party to the contract, please use this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/withdrawal-of-notification-singpass){:target="_blank"}.
