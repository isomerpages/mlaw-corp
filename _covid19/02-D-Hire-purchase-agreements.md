**2. What is the difference between a rental agreement and a hire-purchase agreement?**

* Broadly speaking, in a hire-purchase agreement, ownership of the good passes to the hirer after the payment of all the instalments. 
* In a rental agreement, ownership of the good does not pass to the renter.
*	If you are unsure of the nature of your contract, you should seek legal advice.


<a name="q3">**3. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me, the hirer/debtor?**</a>
*	The Act provides temporary relief from legal or enforcement actions against any failure to pay or breach of contract that is materially caused by a COVID-19 event 
* If you qualify for relief under the Act, the financing company cannot take certain actions against you up to (i) <a href="#19Novnote">19 November 2020</a> (for agreements with banks or MAS-regulated finance companies) and (ii) 31 January 2021 (for agreements with other financing companies), including: 

  * Repossess the plant, machinery or fixed asset that is used for business, or repossess your commercial vehicle.
  * Unilaterally impose new charges, increase charges or interest rates beyond what is provided for in the agreement (please refer to <a href="#q16">FAQ (16)</a> below). 
  * Start or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings.

*	In addition, if your contract is <b><u>not</u></b> with a bank or finance company, the late payment interest rate and charges that are chargeable on arrears that accrued between 1 February 2020 and (i) <a href="#19Novnote">19 November 2020</a> (for agreements with banks or MAS-regulated finance companies) and (ii) 31 January 2021 (for agreements with other financing companies) will be capped at the amount equal to 5% per annum of simple interest on the arrears. In other words, you are not liable to pay any late payment interest or fees above that amount. This helps to reduce the growth of your debt when you are unable to pay due to the impact of COVID-19. See <a href="#q17">FAQs (17) – (29)</a> for more details. Additionally, your financing company may not terminate your contract on the basis that you are unable to make payments on time.

* In order to obtain relief, you must first serve a Notification for Relief on the financing company. See <a href="#q4">FAQ (4)</a> for more details.

<a name="q4">**4. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs?**</a>

* The reliefs under the Act **do not take effect automatically.**

*  If you qualify for the relief, you need to first **serve a Notification for Relief** on the financing company, and your guarantor/surety (if any), using the form at this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass){:target="_blank"} or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass){:target="_blank"}.

* Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the financing company, the financing company cannot take the above actions in <a href="#q3">FAQ (3)</a> above.

#### Specific FAQs ####

<u>Types of agreements and vehicles which the Act applies to</u>

**5. I purchased my car through a hire-purchase agreement for the purposes of my job as a private-hire driver. Does the Act apply to me?**

* Yes, the Act applies to hire-purchase agreements where the good hired or conditionally sold under the agreement is a commercial vehicle. This includes chauffeur-driven private-hire cars (with blue decals).

**6. Does the Act apply to me if I use my vehicle partly for commercial purposes and partly for personal use?**

* It depends on whether your vehicle is a commercial vehicle. Please refer to <a href="#q1">FAQ (1)</a> above.

* A car registered as a chauffeur-driven private hire car (with blue decals) would be considered a commercial vehicle. 

* A personal vehicle used for travel to and from a place of work is not a commercial vehicle.

**7. I am taxi driver or a private-hire driver who rented my car or taxi from a car rental company. I am unable to afford my monthly rent due to COVID-19. Does the Act apply to me?**

* No, the Act does not apply to rental agreements for private-hire cars or taxis. 

* However, the Government has worked closely with the industry and the associations to provide targeted relief to help drivers tide over this challenging period. Please refer to FAQ (6) of the [FAQs for rental agreements for commercial equipment](/covid19-relief/faq/rental-agreements).
  
**8. A customer signed a personal (rather than commercial) hire-purchase agreement for a car. The customer subsequently registered it as a commercial vehicle to do private-hire. Is such a car covered by the Act?** 

*	Yes. A car used for private-hire and registered as a chauffeur-driven private-hire vehicle (with blue decals) is covered by the Act, even if the hire-purchase agreement signed is a personal rather than commercial agreement.

<u>Eligibility and scope of the relief</u>

<u>I am a hirer..</u>

**9. I am an individual / a vehicle leasing company with a hire-purchase agreement with a financing company. Does the Act apply to me?** 
*	The Act applies to hire-purchase agreements for commercial vehicles. It applies regardless of whether the hirer is an individual or a company.

**10. My business suffered a drop of revenue due to COVID-19. Under the Act, must I still continue paying the instalments?** 

* The instalment continues to be payable under the contract. However, the Act prevents the financing company from repossessing the plant, machinery or fixed asset that is used for business or commercial vehicle, or commencing or continuing legal action during the prescribed period (i.e. (i) <a href="#19Novnote">19 November 2020</a> (for agreements with banks or MAS-regulated finance companies) and (ii) 31 January 2021 (for agreements with other financing companies)). This gives the hirer and the financing company time to negotiate a mutually acceptable way to deal with the arrears.

* The relief applies only to hirers who can demonstrate that they are unable to pay the instalments due to COVID-19. It does not allow hirers who are able to pay to avoid paying. Hirers who have the ability to pay (even if they suffered a drop in revenue) must continue to pay the instalment.

**11. I was unable to pay the instalment that fell due before 1 February 2020. Does the Act apply to arrears from before 1 February 2020?** 

* No, the Act applies only to the inability to pay the instalments due to COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 to (i) <a href="#19Novnote">19 November 2020</a> (for agreements with banks or MAS-regulated finance companies) and (ii) 31 January 2021 (for agreements with other financing companies). The financing company is entitled to enforce any contractual rights they have for unpaid instalments due before 1 February 2020.

**12. I served a Notification for Relief on 1 June 2020. I have already paid instalments for February to May 2020 prior to serving the Notification for Relief. Must the hirer return the instalments paid to me?** 

*	No, the Act does not provide such relief. 

*	Please also note that the relief that the Act does not waive instalment payments under a hire-purchase agreement. Any unpaid instalments continue to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period. Please refer to <a href="#q14">FAQ (14)</a> for details.

**13. I am unable to pay the instalment due to COVID-19. Should I issue a Notification for Relief or apply for an Assessor’s determination under the Act?**

* If you have been affected by COVID-19, and are unable to perform your contractual obligations, we would encourage you to work together with your financing company to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. 

* For both parties, a settlement is preferable to being mired in costly and lengthy legal proceedings.

* If you cannot reach an agreement yet and require protection from legal proceedings, you may serve a Notification for Relief on your financing company, who is then prohibited from taking any of the actions in <a href="#q3">FAQ (3)</a>. This will give you temporary protection up to (i) <a href="#19Novnote">19 November 2020</a> (for agreements with banks or MAS-regulated finance companies) and (ii) 31 January 2021 (for agreements with other financing companies).

* For the avoidance of doubt, the instalment continues to accrue in the interim.  You are therefore encouraged to use the temporary relief period to work out a solution. 

* In the event of a dispute over whether there is an inability to pay the instalment, or whether that inability is materially caused by COVID-19, either party may make an application to the Assessor, who will seek to achieve an outcome that is just and equitable in the circumstances. Please click on this [link](/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and the relevant forms.

<a name="q14">**14. Do I have to pay the accrued unpaid instalments (and other charges if any) after the 6-month relief period?**</a>

* Yes. The unpaid instalments (and any other charges such as interest or fees for late payment, if provided for under the contract) continue to accrue during the relief period, and may be enforced after the relief period. 

* The Act seeks to temporarily prohibit the financing company from enforcing the contract during the relief period. (Please see <a href="#q15">FAQ (15) to (29)</a> below for more information on interest fees for late payment).

* While this gives the hirer  some breathing space without the threat of repossession or litigation to sort out his finances, he may be subject to a higher outstanding amount at the end of the temporary relief period as the interest or fees for late payment continues to accrue under his contract with the financing company. 

* As such, hirers are encouraged to engage their financing companies to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution. 

<a name="q15">**15. Can a financing company charge the hirer interest or other fees for late payment during the relief period, after the hirer serves the Notification for Relief?**</a>

* If the agreement provides that the financing company can charge interest or charges (be it for late payment or otherwise), interest and other charges would accrue and can be enforced by the financing company after the relief period. 

* However, the financing company may <b><u>not</u> unilaterally increase the charges payable by the hirer</b>. See <a href="#q16">FAQ (16)</a> below. Further, if your contract is <b><u>not</u></b> with a bank or finance company, the late payment interest and charges may be subject to a cap. See <a href="#q17">FAQs (17) – (29)</a> below.  

<a name="q16">**16. The financing company says that it is exercising its right to increase the interest payable under the hire-purchase agreement.  Can it do so?**</a>

* If a hirer has served a Notification for Relief on the financing company, under the Act, the financing company is not permitted to:

  * Increase any charges or interest rate payable under the contract unless such increase 
   <br>(i) is specified in the contract; 
  <br>(ii) is calculated by reference to a formula (e.g. a reference rate) in the contract; 
  <br>(iii)  relates to expenses reasonably incurred by the financing company in the ordinary course of business; or
<br>(iv) is further agreed to by the hirer. 

  * Impose new charges except with the further agreement of the hirer.

* The table below illustrates when an increase in interest rate or charges, or an imposition of new charges or interest, is or is not permitted. 

|  **Example**  |  **Permitted**  |  **Not Permitted** |
|--|--|--| 
|Contract provides that the financing company may charge “_an additional x% p.a. or such other rate as it may in its discretion prescribe_” on overdue payments.|Financing company can charge the additional x% p.a.| Financing company cannot increase the rate above the additional x% unless the hirer further agrees to the increased rate.|
|Contract provides that the financing company may charge “$_x a day for each day the payment is not satisfied in full, or any such other charge at its discretion_”.|Financing company can charge $x a day for each day the payment is not satisfied in full.  |Financing company cannot rely on this clause to increase the charges to more than $x a day, unless the hirer further agrees to the increased charges.|
|Contract provides that the hirer shall “_pay interest at SIBOR plus x% p.a., or such other rate as may be determined by the financing company_" in the event of default.|Financing company can charge the stipulated additional interest at SIBOR plus x% p.a.|Financing company cannot increase the rate beyond SIBOR plus x% p.a., unless the hirer further agrees to the increased rate.| 
|Contract provides that financing company may “_impose any charges at its discretion_”.|Financing company can impose charges where it relates to expenses that it has reasonably incurred in the ordinary course of business, e.g. administrative charges (including increase) which are based on the financing company’s internal schedule of charges and are collected from other hirers with similar hire-purchase agreements.|Financing company cannot rely on this clause to impose a charge that is not reasonably incurred in the ordinary course of business, unless the hirer’s further consent is obtained.|
|Contract provides that the financing company "_reserves the right to vary the conditions in the agreement without the hirer’s consent_”.|-|Financing company cannot rely on this clause to increase or introduce any new interest or charges, unless the hirer’s further consent is obtained.|

<a name="q17">**17. What are the arrears that will be subject to the cap on late payment interest and charges?**</a>

* The cap applies in respect of arrears that accrued between 1 February 2020 and <a href="#19Novnote">31 January 2021</a> due to COVID-19, if your contract is **not** with a bank or finance company. 

**18. What happens to arrears that have accrued before 1 February, or after <a href="#19Novnote">31 January 2021</a> (e.g., arrears for the month of January 2020)?**

* The relief does not apply to such arrears. The contractual late payment interest and charges will apply. 

**19. What is the cap on late payment interest or charges?**

* The cap is the amount equal to 5% per annum of simple interest on the arrears. 

**20. How does the cap on late payment interest rate and charges work?**

* Once the Notification for Relief is served, all late payment interest and charges that are chargeable on arrears that accrued between 1 February 2020 and <a href="#19Novnote">31 January 2021</a> will be capped at an amount equal to 5% per annum of simple interest.  

* Please click [here](/covid19-relief/cap-on-late-payment-interest-charges) for illustrations on how the cap on late payment interest and charges work. 

**21. What happens if the financing company insists that I pay interest or charges that exceed the cap?**

* You will not be liable to pay any late payment interest or charges that exceed the cap. 

**22. Am I still liable to pay the financing company ordinary interest?**

* The cap only applies to <b><u>late payment</u></b> interest and charges. The usual interest and charges that the financing company charges in the absence of any late payments is not capped. 

**23. Can parties agree to a late payment interest rate that is below the cap?**

* Yes. We encourage parties to work together to reach a mutually acceptable solution. A long-term solution will give all parties a better chance to recover from the impact of COVID-19. 

**24. I entered into a compromise or settlement with my financing company before I served a Notification for Relief. Does this relief apply to me?**

* No, the relief will not apply if you have entered into a compromise or settlement before serving the Notification for Relief on your financing company. 

**25. I have paid my financing company late payment interest and charges above the cap. Can I serve a Notification for Relief on the financing company and get a refund?**

* You cannot claim a refund of any late payment interest or charges that you have already paid. 

**26. Can the financing company terminate my hire-purchase agreement because I am unable to pay on time?**

* After you serve a Notification for Relief in accordance with the Act, the financing company may not terminate your contract on the basis that you are unable to make payments on time. Any such termination will be invalid under the Act. This only applies if your contract is <b><u>not</u></b> with a bank or finance company.

**27. Why does the prescribed cap on late payment interest and charges under Section 7A not apply to my hire-purchase agreement with a bank or finance company?**

* Banks and finance companies, working with MAS, have already adopted a series of voluntary relief measures for individuals and businesses. Please click [here](/covid19-relief/cap-on-late-payment-interest-charges) for further details. 

**28. I served my financing company with a Notification for Relief before the cap on late payment interest and charges was brought into force on 31 July 2020. Does the cap apply to me? Do I need to serve the financing company with another Notification for Relief?**

* Yes, the cap on late payment interest and charges can apply to you, even if you served the Notification for Relief before the cap was brought into force on 31 July 2020. You do not need to serve the financing company with another Notification for Relief. 

**29. I applied for and received an Assessor’s Determination before the cap on late payment interest and charges was brought into force on 31 July 2020. Does the cap apply to me?**

* If your determination provides that section 5 of the Act applies in respect of your inability to make payment under the hire-purchase agreement, and the financing company is not a bank or finance company, the cap on late payment interest and charges will apply to those payments that you were unable to make. 

**30. What can I do if my financing company threatens to repossess my vehicle after I have served a Notification for Relief?** 

*	It is unlawful and an offence for your financing company to repossess your vehicle, or start court or insolvency proceedings against you after you serve a Notification for Relief in accordance with the Act. 
*	We encourage you to reach out to your financing company to confirm that he had received your Notification for Relief, and to commence negotiations to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
*	If no agreement is reached, and the financing company does not agree that you are entitled to relief under the Act (and wishes to proceed with repossession of your vehicle, or commencement of court or insolvency proceedings), either party may make an application to the Assessor, who will determine whether the relief is applicable. Please click on this [link](/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor) for further information on the application process and relevant forms.

**31. My financing company repossessed my commercial vehicle before the Act commenced. Does the Act apply to me?**

* Part 2 of the [Act](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/act/covid19tma2020){:target="_blank"} on Temporary Relief for Inability to Perform Contracts commenced on 20 April 2020. It does not apply to repossessions that occurred before that date. 

* If you believe that the financing company breached the terms of your hire-purchase agreement, please seek legal advice.

**32. My financing company repossessed my commercial vehicle before I served the Notification for Relief. Does the Act apply to me?**

* The Act does not apply to a repossession that occurred before the Notification for Relief was served. 
* If you believe that the financing company breached the terms of your hire-purchase agreement, please seek legal advice.

**33. I served the Notification for Relief on my financing company, but did not get any response or acknowledgement. What do I do next?** 

*	You may wish to reach out to your financing company to ensure that it received the Notification for Relief, and commence negotiations.  
*	We encourage financing companies and hirers to be reasonable and to work out a mutually acceptable solution to the contractual issues that have been created by COVID-19.


<u>I am a guarantor…</u>

**34. I am a guarantor for a hire-purchase agreement. The financing company has been asking me for payment. Should my hirer and I each file a Notification for Relief? If my hirer does not serve a Notification for Relief, can I serve a Notification for Relief on the financing company?** 

*	If you are the guarantor but not a party to the hire-purchase agreement, you may not serve the Notification for Relief. 
*	Under the Act, only a party to a hire-purchase agreement may serve a Notification for Relief for his inability to perform the obligations under the hire-purchase agreement. 
*	The hirer should serve a Notification for Relief using this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass) or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass). In Part B of the form, the hirer should indicate the particulars of both the financing company and the guarantor. A copy of the same Notification for Relief should be served on both the financing company and the guarantor. 
*	If the hirer serves a Notification for Relief on the financing company, and the other conditions in the Act are satisfied, the financing company will be prohibited from commencing court or insolvency proceedings against both the hirer and the guarantor. 
*	If the hirer does not file a Notification for Relief, the hirer can be sued by the financing company, or can be brought in as a third party in any legal proceedings that may be commenced against the guarantor.

<u>I am a financing company…</u>

**35. My company is a vehicle leasing company. A customer served us a Notification for Relief in relation to a rental agreement for a vehicle used as a private-hire car/ taxi that does not fall within the Act. What do we do next?**
*	The Notification for Relief has no effect as the Act does not cover a rental agreement for a vehicle used as a private-hire car or a taxi.
*	Even though the Notification for Relief was served in error, this indicates that your customer has difficulties meeting his contractual obligations to you under the car rental agreement. We encourage you to engage with your customer to work out a mutually acceptable solution to deal with these contractual issues that have been caused by COVID-19.
*	If you are unable to reach an agreement with your customer and wish to dispute the Notification for Relief, you may make an application to the Assessor by following the steps in this link. The Assessor will determine whether relief under the Act applies.
