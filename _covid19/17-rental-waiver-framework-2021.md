### 2021 Rental Waiver Framework for SMEs and NPOs ###

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment No. 4) Bill ( “Bill”) that was introduced in Parliament on 13 September 2021 provides a Rental Waiver Framework (RWF) under Part 12 of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act (“Act”) for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and specified non-profit organisations (NPOs). If the Bill is passed, the RWF is expected to commence in October 2021.

The RWF complements the suite of support measures introduced by the Government to alleviate the economic impact on businesses due to the tightened safe management measures imposed during the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) [P2(HA)] periods, including the Rental Support Scheme (RSS) introduced by the Ministry of Finance.

The RWF will ensure the fair co-sharing of rental obligations over the P2(HA) periods between the Government, landlords and eligible tenants. Taken together with the RSS cash payouts, qualifying tenants in privately owned commercial properties will benefit from a total of about 1.5 months of rental support.

The mandatory rental waiver under the RWF is intended to establish a baseline position for the handling of tenants’ rental obligations. Landlords and tenants are encouraged to work out mutually agreeable arrangements based on their specific circumstances.
