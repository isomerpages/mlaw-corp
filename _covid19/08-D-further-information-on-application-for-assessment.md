Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Rental and Related Measures) Regulations 2020, if a landlord and tenant-occupier are unable to reach a compromise, the property owner and/or any intermediary landlord(s) may make an application for assessment by a rental relief assessor. The rental relief assessment process is managed by an office called the Registry of Rental Relief Assessors, which is under the control and supervision of the Registrar. 

The application for assessment must be made within 10 working days after receiving (a copy of) the notice of cash grant, and a rental relief assessor can ascertain any of the following:

   a)	Whether the tenant-occupier is eligible for Rental Relief and/or Additional Rental Relief; and/or

   b)	Whether the applicant landlord qualifies to provide only half the Additional Rental Relief, on the basis of financial hardship.

##### <a name="hardship">Landlord Financial Hardship</a><a href="#refa" title="Return to top">↩</a> #####

Landlords who meet all the following criteria may apply to a rental relief assessor to reduce the amount of Additional Rental Relief they have to provide:

   a)	The applicant landlord must be an individual or a sole proprietor, and the owner of the prescribed property;

   b)	The aggregate of the annual value of all investment properties (including the prescribed property) owned by the landlord (whether directly or through one or more investment holding companies) is not more than S$60,000 as at 13 April 2020; and

   c)	The rental income derived from all the properties that the landlord must provide Additional Rental Relief for in Year of Assessment 2019 or a later appropriate period<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> constituted 75% or more of the landlord’s gross income. 

If the landlord meets the grounds of financial hardship above, the rental relief assessor may halve the amount of Additional Rental Relief to be borne by the landlord, i.e. one month’s rental waiver for qualifying commercial properties, or half a month’s rental waiver for other non-residential properties (e.g. industrial and office properties). The remaining rent payable will be borne by the tenant.

<p><sup id="fn1">1. If the lease commenced in 2018 or earlier, <b><u>and</u></b> the landlord was required to file an income tax return in YA2019, the period will be YA2019. If the lease commenced in 2019, <b><u>and</u></b> the landlord was required to file an income tax return in YA2020, the period will be YA2020. In any other case, the relevant period will be the rental relief period, i.e. 1 April to 31 July 2020 for qualifying commercial properties, or 1 April to 31 May 2020 for other non-residential properties.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>

##### <a name="powers">Expanded Powers of Rental Relief Assessors</a><a href="#refa" title="Return to top">↩</a> #####

On 30 September 2020, the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Amendment No. 2) Bill came into force, expanding the powers of the rental relief assessors. Rental relief assessors can now also make determinations on unresolved disputes relating to the amount of rent to be waived under the framework, where the amount is affected by any of the following factors:

a) The amount of maintenance and service charges<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, especially where such charges are not explicitly listed in the lease or licence agreement

b) The amount that can be offset by assistance provided by the landlord earlier

c) Tenant(s) occupying the property for only a part of the relief period

d) Sub-division of the property, i.e. there are multiple sub-tenants, not all of whom may be eligible for the waivers

The expanded powers only apply to unresolved disputes involving any of the above, and landlords and tenants can make the application for such determinations. The rental relief assessors will not review existing arrangements that have been mutually agreed upon between landlords and tenants on the implementation of the rental waivers.

<p><sup id="fn2">2. Maintenance and service charges are excluded from the rental waivers.<a href="#ref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">↩</a></sup></p>
