### Construction contracts or supply contracts, or any performance bond granted thereto ###
<a name="31Marnote"><u>Important Note</u></a>: The prescribed period for construction or supply contracts ended on 28 February 2022. If you have served or received a Notification for Relief in relation to a construction or supply contract, and there is a dispute as to whether the reliefs triggered by the Notification for Relief apply, you may still file an [Application for an Assessor's Determination](/covid19-relief/application-for-assessor). Please take note that the deadline to file such an application is 30 April 2022.


*	For more information about the relief under the Act for construction and supply contracts, please refer to the [FAQs on BCA’s website](https://www1.bca.gov.sg/docs/default-source/docs-corp-news-and-publications/faqs---covid19/faqs-commencement-covid19-temporary-measures-act-for-built-environment.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

#### General FAQs ####
**1. What types of construction or supply contracts are covered by the Act?**

* Construction and supply contracts within the meaning of section 2 of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act (Cap. 30B)(“**BCISOPA**”) are covered.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Act covers contracts which are excluded from the application of the BSCISOPA pursuant to section 4 of the BCISOPA (e.g. renovation contracts for private residential property), except contracts to the extent that a party carries out construction work or supply goods or services as an employee (within the meaning of the Employment Act (Cap. 91)).


**2. I am a party to a construction or supply contract. What reliefs under the Act are applicable to me?**

* First, if you are unable to perform your obligations due to COVID-19, the other party to the contract cannot commence or continue court proceedings or insolvency proceedings against you during the prescribed period (i.e. up to <a href="#31Marnote">28 February 2022</a>). For the avoidance of doubt, adjudication proceedings under the BCISOPA will remain available to the relevant parties during the prescribed period.

* Second, if you are a contractor who is unable to supply goods or services due to Covid-19, the Act gives you a defence against any claims for breach of contract or damages (e.g. liquidated damages) due to that inability to perform the obligation.

*	This defence is available to you only after you have served the Notification for Relief during the prescribed period. It may be raised separately in dispute resolution proceedings – in adjudication (under the BCISOPA), arbitration or court proceedings between the relevant parties, separate from the regime under the COVID-19 Act. 
  * For the avoidance of doubt, under the Act, **the Assessor’s determination is limited to (a) whether the party to the construction or supply contract is unable to perform an obligation; and (b) whether the inability is to a material extent caused by COVID-19**. The Assessor would not assess or determine the extent of delay that is attributable to COVID-19, and the amount of liquidated damages or damages payable. 
  
*	In addition, under the Act, if you are unable to perform your contractual obligations due to COVID-19, the other party is also prohibited from calling on a performance bond in relation to that inability earlier than 7 days before the expiry of the performance bond, for the prescribed period (i.e. up till <a href="#31Marnote">28 February 2022</a>). 

**3. What must I do to enjoy the reliefs?**

* The reliefs under the Act **do not take effect automatically.**

* To qualify for the relief, you need to first **serve a Notification for Relief** on the other party to the contract, using the form at this [link (SingPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-singpass){:target="_blank"} or this [link (CorpPass)](https://go.gov.sg/notification-for-relief-corppass){:target="_blank"}. 

* Once the Notification for Relief has been served on the other party to the contract, the reliefs in FAQ (2) will apply.

**4.  I am unable to perform my contract due to COVID-19, and have served a Notification for Relief on my counterparty.  Can my counterparty still call on my performance bond?**

* If you are unable to perform your contractual obligation under the construction contract due to Covid-19, you may serve a Notification for Relief on the other party to the contract and the issues of the the performance bond.

* Once you have served the Notification for Relief, the other party to the contract may not make a call on the performance bond in respect of the inability described in the Notification for Relief at any time earlier than: 

  * 7 days before the date of expiry of the performance bond as stated in the bond; or 

  * 7 days before the date of expiry of the performance bond as extended under the Act. 

*	The above will cease to apply on the earliest of the following events: 
	   * Upon the expiry of the prescribed period (i.e., after 28 February 2022)
    
    * The withdrawal of your Notification for Relief
    
    * If either party has made an Application for an Assessor’s Determination, the making of the Assessor’s Determination that you do not meet the requirements under the Act.
    
*	Additionally, section 6(3) allows you to make an application to extend the term of the bond to the issuer of the bond. This must be done not less than 7 days before the expiry of the bond. A notice of the application (to extend the term of the bond) must also be served on the other parties to the construction contract at the same time.  

* Once you have done the above, section 6(3) of the Act provides that the term of the bond will be extended under the Act to a date 7 days after the end of the prescribed period (i.e., extended to 7 March 2022) or such other date agreed between you, the other parties to the construction contract, and the issuer of the bond.
