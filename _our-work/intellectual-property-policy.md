> Intellectual property (IP) rights are essential to support an innovation-driven economy and the growth of industry and commerce in Singapore. The Ministry of Law (MinLaw) is committed to maintaining an IP regime that is balanced, well-regarded internationally, and supports value creation.


MinLaw oversees various aspects of IP policy, including those relating to patents, trade marks, copyright, registered designs, plant varieties, geographical indications and trade secrets. Specific functions include reviewing and updating our domestic IP protection and enforcement regime so that it supports economic goals; fostering the growth of a vibrant IP services sector; and safeguarding Singaporeâ€™s interests in international forums.
