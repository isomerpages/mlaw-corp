#### **Singapore is a republic with a parliamentary system of Government based on the Westminster Model.**

The roots of Singapore’s legal system can be traced back to the English legal system and it has evolved over the years. Our sources of law are derived from our [Constitution](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963){:target="_blank"}, [legislation](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}, subsidiary legislation (e.g. Rules and Regulations etc) and judge-made law. 

* The **Constitution** is the supreme law of the land and lays down the basic framework for the three organs of state, namely, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.
